            "Review text: Where do I begin. This movie was a huge disappointment for me from the first scene. First of all, the actor they chose to play Han lacks all the charm and charisma of the character we've come to love. He's a painfully manufactured \"scoundrel\" and there is absolutely no spark between any of the characters. The storyline is terribly rushed. They obviously tried to cram as many references about Han Solo into 2 hours and 15 minutes as they could which came across sloppy, cheap and painfully obvious. There's a disappointing lack of any wit or humor in the dialog, so much so that sitting through this movie is dull and frankly, boring. This movie should have never been made. This is a desecration I think we will all soon forget.\n",

            "Review text: As I reminisce about the first time I saw Hans Solo, his daring escapades, has strong flawed character, his sharp wit, he was a space traveling Indiana Jones, telling a fresh story, even now, as I rewatch the old star wars, which is older than me at 41 years old, still has a fresh feel. Solo, which came out today in my neck of the woods, feels like it was made of old bland ideas that have now been shot out into space with added CGI. It is an average film at best, but as a film in the Star Wars brand, it is well below expectation. Three words spring to mind. Could do Better. This film deserves 5/10 but I'm giving it a 1/10 to send a message that the direction the Star Wars Brand is going isn't \"Star Wars\" for me. Solo is an average space drama with and average script, nothing more nothing less\n",

            "Review text: Let me just say that I am a HUGE fan of Star Wars. I watch the movies, read the comics and the books, buy the lightsabers and all that stuff. But enough is enough!The film starts with really enhanced Instagram color filters. Then we continue to the battlefield where this doesn't remind you at all about a war happening in the stars. We also acknowledge that Chewbacca is an idiot and cannot think of destroying the column by himself; even though the way he does it in the movie, he should have killed Han in the first place while throwing him against that metal bar.In the next scene, we learn something very interesting: in Star Wars the transportation of fragile and important materials is happening by train. Yes Sir, by train! Although there's some good action here, it feels kind of cheesy when a lady smuggler sacrifices herself without reason, just because someone cannot die without drama in Star Wars.Our lady, Emilia Clark, she forgets that she's playing in science fiction war movie, thus she is more like going for shopping in mall or joining a gala. She's constantly dressed up in Hollywood-style-of dresses or whatever that is unfit for action. They don't have chemistry at all with Han. Nobody cares if they are in love or not, even the characters themselves exchange some fake kisses, making their relationship even more awkward.And the even everything else was not bad enough, we have a movie about Han Solo, without Han Solo. The problem is not just that the actor is not looking like Harrison Ford, but he's also not acting as the Han Solo we all know. He's character (scenario/plot) is a super cynical dude. I don't know why the wrote his character like that. The comic-relief with the robot is just plain stupid. I really enjoyed when she died, although I don't get how a robot can really die. Too much drama for Lando in this scene.The movie has a lot of pointless action, they even got Kraken from Pirates of Caribbean into space but still everything looks so boring and expected. Yet the plot twist in the end comes out of nowhere. The character of Han is just ... completely unable to think or act like that. It feels weird that he can actually think or shoot first. Anyway, where this movie takes place? I am asking because it looks like Han Solo should be ~60 old in The Return of the Jedi unless they resurrected Darth Maul.In general: lazy script, very bad pace, bad characters, very flat and uninteresting movie. I don't think I will ever see it again. It's a good movie and it's not about paying a tribute to Han Solo. It's all about Disney milking the cow with a risk-free plot, which looks more like an enumeration of events, rather than an interesting story to tell.\n",

Lots of backlighting, very little front lighting watching actors do their stuff in the dark and hearing their voices but not being able to see their faces. I wasn't impressed. Even the scenes shot in snow and deserts were dark and gloomy, clearly something wrong with the atmospherics here? Besides all this, as an action venture with no storyline, a pretty aweful script, no real evidential crossover links to the rest of the Star Wars universe its was OK, as a supposed Star Wars movie, in my opinion, it failed badly.....or perhaps I misssed all the good bits whilst I was asleep?\n",

Surely the franchise that shaped my childhood hadn't completely imploded. Right?Wrong.The moment the movie opened with the thrilling white-knuckle speeder chase scene - which literally appeared to be taking place at about 40mph - I knew that my hopes of not regretting looking up to Han Solo as a child were in grave danger.The music was great. Maybe too great. It was the first time I've ever had the music actually take me out of the experience. I often found myself thinking, \"These visuals aren't nearly interesting or important enough to justify this intense music.\" Unfortunately, almost every action scene, and even the \"big moments\" like Han and Chewy sitting in the cockpit together for the first time, simply fell flat.There were plenty of explosions, but they forgot to pull us in with characters and a plot that we could care about. It felt like a factory assembly line movie, where the studio recycles a bunch of proven parts, and expects us to buy the product because we've bought it so many times in the past. Unfortunately, they forgot to include a battery, and that little mistake left it completely lifeless.As Yoda might say, \"Big music and big budget a great movie do not make.\"I literally watched Solo solo...because about 30 minutes into the movie, the only other person in the theater left. And I would have followed suit, but I just kept believing that it would get better. It had to get better. It's a movie about Han Solo.But it didn't. It was another politically correct, agenda-infused Disney dud that, quite honestly, riding on the coattails of \"The Last Jedi\", has officially left me feeling embarrassed that I ever liked Star Wars in the first place.And am I the only one who made it far enough into the movie to see Lando wailing in agony over the \"death\" of his droid? That was just embarrassing. I couldn't help but laugh, not only because it was hilarious, but also as a way of venting the sudden awareness that my childhood fascination with these characters from a galaxy far, far away had just died.I couldn't watch more than 5 minutes at a time without re-writing lines of dialogue in my mind. Were they even trying at the script phase of production, or did they just scramble to get a bunch of words on the pages so they could get to the fun part of creating digital creatures and backdrops?Who knows? All I know is that it's time to finally acknowledge that Star Wars is and will always be George Lucas' brain child. And apparently the adoption process for brain children doesn't turn out well.\n",

            "Review text: I'd really love to tell you about the plot. I really would! But I would struggle to pull all the multitude of strands together from J.K. Rowling's story and coherently explain them to anyone. If Rowling had put ten thousand monkeys (not a million - it's no bloody Shakespeare) into a room with typewriters and locked the door I wouldn't be surprised.Let me try at a high level..... The arch-criminal wizard Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) is being tortured in 'Trump Tower', but manages to escape and flees to Paris in pursuit of a mysterious circus performer called Credence (Ezra Miller) and his bewitched companion Nagini (nudge, nudge, wink, wink) played fetchingly by Claudia Kim. Someone needs to stop him, and all eyes are on Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law). But he is unable to do so, since he and Grindelwald are \"closer than brothers\" (nudge, nudge, wink, wink). So a reluctant and UK-grounded Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) is smuggled into the danger zone... which suits him just fine since his love Tina (Katherine Waterston) is working for the ministry there, and the couple are currently estranged due to a (topical) bout of 'Fake News'.Throw in a potential love triangle between Newt, his brother Theseus (Callum Turner) and old Hogwart's schoolmate Leta Lestrange (Zoë Kravitz) and about a half dozen other sub-plots and you have... well... a complete muggle - - sorry - - muddle.Above all, I really can't explain the crux of the plot. A venerable diarrhoea of exposition in a crypt, during an inexplicably quiet fifteen minutes (given 'im-who-can-be-named is next door with about a thousand other people!) left me completely bewildered. A bizarre event at sea (no spoilers) would seem to make absolutely NO SENSE when considered with another reveal at the end of the film. I thought I must have clearly missed something... or I'd just not been intelligent enough to process the information.... or.... it was actually completely bonkers! Actually, I think it's the latter: in desperation I went on a fan site that tried to explain the plot. While it was explained there, the explanation aligned with what I thought had happened: but it made no mention of the ridiculousness of the random coincidence involved!The film's a mess. Which is a shame since everyone involved tries really hard. Depp oozes evil very effectively (he proves that nicely on arriving in Paris, and doubles-down about 5 minutes later: #veryverydark). Redmayne replays his Newt-act effectively but once again (and I see I made the same comments in my \"Fantastic Beasts\" review) his character mumbles again so much that many of his lines are unintelligible.I also complained last time that the excellent actress Katherine Waterston was criminally underused as the tentative love interest Tina. this trend unfortunately continues unabated in this film.... you'll struggle afterwards to write down what she actually did in this film.Jacob (Dan Fogler) and Queenie (Alison Sudol, looking for all the world in some scenes like Rachel Weisz) reprise their roles in a sub-plot that goes nowhere in particular.Of the newcomers, Jude Law as Dumbledore is a class-act but has very little screen time: hopefully he will get more to do next time around. Zoë Kravitz impresses as Leta.As you would expect from a David Yates / David Heyman Potter collaboration, the product design, costume design and special effects are all excellent. Some scenes are truly impressive - an 'explosion' in a Parisian garret is particularly spectacular. But special effects alone do not a great film make. Many reviews I've seen complain that this was a 'filler' film... a set-up film for the rest of the series. And I can understand that view. If you analyse the film overall, virtually NOTHING of importance actually happens: it's like the \"Order of the Phoenix\" of the prequels.I dragged myself along to see this one because \"I thought I should\". The third in the series will really need to sparkle to make me want to see it. If J.K. Rowling were to take me advice (she won't - she NEVER returns my calls!) then she would sculpt the story-arc but leave the screenwriting to someone better. The blame for this one, I'm afraid, lies at Rowling's door alone.\n",

            "Review text: The one thing this movie successfully does, is cast an obliviate on you. I literally just watched it, and I don't even remember what it's about. The magical element of this film is simply having so much happen, while simultaneously, nothing really happens.There's a little bit of nostalgia, with Easter eggs and great visuals; the actors are great- Johnny Depp has the most menacing introduction I've seen; Jude Law convinced me that he is young Dumbledore; the music is spectacular. But none of that can hide the truth of the fact that this movie is just BORING.There is literally so much plot thrown at you non-stop. The movie expects you to care about, invest in and remember so many characters, that at some point, you mentally clock out. I'm an intense potterhead, and I love learning more l about the wizarding world. But this is just too much information, being force-fed in very little time. I've enjoyed every single Harry Potter film so far... but I just can't stomach this story.Remember at the end of the first Fantastic Beasts movie, when you enjoyed watching it,but you hesitated to gravitate towards it. You had a small shred of doubt if it was a one time thing,or does this genuinely have the potential to be something incredible. There's no longer a doubt.\n",

            "Review title: Most Disappointing Film Of The Year.\n",
            "Review text: Truly horrendous. Easily the most disappointing film I have seen all year, on a fundamental level this film was flawed, the primary culprit bing J.k Rowling and the extreme amounts of creative dominance she must have been given in the writing process.First, I must praise certain aspects of this motion picture, although there is little to commend. The performances were for the most part a strength (Although some let the side down), most notably Jude Law as Albus Dumbledore was wonderful as the caring, charming and more complex young Dumbledore. In addition to this, I must comment that Johnny Depp was a surprisingly positive cast member, also Eddie Redmayne was alright, a little overdone on the mumbling aspect but still a pleasure to see. The rest of the cast was fairly competent with the exception of those that will be stated later on.The screenplay of this film, what can I say. I have only negatives to deliver on this aspect. I can only image that what occurred was similar to George Lucas during the Star Wars Prequels - constantly surrounded by people who would only say 'Yes' to all the decisions. Because they are the one who mad the great original series, surely they can do no wrong. Oh how history has repeated Itself.This screenplay fails on the basic fundamentals of story telling, show don't tell. Most of this picture is two hours of continuous uninteresting drear, badly written with actors struggling to convey the poor choices and dialogue delivered by Rowling. I may be mistaken but in one scene in particular, in Hogwarts, Theseus Scamander gets called a 'Weasley' - If this is memory is true, it is symbolic of the shoddiness and laziness of the screenplay and many of the the basic failures of this film.The film follows two almost entirely unconnected threads, one of Credence and the other of Scamander. Both are boring, and the juxtaposition between them is jarring and fuel for confusion. The Credence plot-line is particularly of failure, it is highly unclear and unexplained, and is just 45 minutes of useless meandering with no emotional impact or significance to the plot as a whole. I even found Ezra Miller to almost seem as of he was struggling to even portray this incredibly bland, standard and boring character. I am one who knows a fair amount about the Harry Potter universe and at first I even didn't get the Nagini reference, until she became a snake in a very unnecessary and out of the blue scene, for she has zero effect upon even Credences story, I cant remember if she spoke a single line, and was so badly delivered by her actress by the fault of Rowling's screenplay.Newt Scamander's plot-line was almost equally as uninteresting and badly executed, for in his plotline, he barely does anything. Once could have removed Tina, Jacob, Queenie, Leta Lestrange, Theseus, Yusuf and Abernathy and the plot-line would have ended in petty much exactly the same place. It is overcrowded, and it is truly a waste of acting talent. For all these performers are of a high caliber and here do nothing. All these characters were uninteresting with the exception of Queenie who had a somewhat interesting arc but was executed badly due to Rowlings screenplay, this singular arc had much more potential.This plot-line is extremely convoluted, Newt Scamander has just over an hour of screen time, despite this being his movie, he is surprisingly not in it a great deal. There is one scene in particular which evokes my mention of the lack of the basic \"show don't tell\" fundamental of story telling. In this scene Leta Lestrange, Yusuf and the rest of the gang excluding Queenie, they use flashbacks to explain a plot thread about one characters lineage. It is extremely convoluted, and involves the Titanic, forced exposition and some complain about forced diversity (In making one of the Lestrages Black) but I dot not say that is a valid criticism. Overall this is supposed to tie up and be an evocative emotional moment for the majority of the characters in the narrative, but as the characters had little to no initial characterisation, the convolutedness only adds to the boredom, as the audience simply does not care for what is being presented, as well as how it is just exposition bing vomited at the audience, it is flimsy, boring and at the most fundamental bad film making, and entirely undefendable.As a result, all of the new characters introduced in this feature hold no significance to the plot, nor are emotionally invested in, thus a waste of time. In addition to this, Jacob is fairly wasted in this feature, he doesn't grow as a character and simply tags along like a fish out of water that is no longer funny for the most part. Although the running salamander joke was effective, but this was his sole contribution to the film, all he does is look shocked or hold buckets.Tina Goldstein played by Katherine Waterston is absolutely wasted as both a character and an actress. Such promise laid in this films precursor and yet contributes nothing to this feature, she had no function to the story nor any emotional impact on the audience at all. A total waste of Katherine Waterston who is a great talent in other motion pictures.Gellert Grindelwald was played by Johnny Depp. And wow, what a mixed bag, one the one had he was handled well by Depp however in terms of characterisation and villainy, Rowling has really let the side down. Apart from the reasonably good opening scene, Grindelwald is unthreataning, bland and disappears for large chunks of the narrative. Fo a film which bares his name, he was hardly the focal point (Nor was Newt Scamander, thus who is the foci of this film?) Grindelwald flat out says he doesn't want to kill muggles, or hurt them, so why is he a threat? What are his crimes? All the characters simply talk about how bad he was, it is never shown apart from one cliche scene of killing a family, it hold little emotional wight or significance. Once again this flaw falls on Rowling and fundamental rule of \"Show don't tell\". Which I needn't divulge again. But this displays the fatal flaw of this film, how it fails on a very basic level, to deliver a crude, boring, uninteresting and convoluted product. In addition to this, Rowling includes very unsubtle Anti-Trump undertones which when delivered well can be thought provoking but in this film, are not delivered well and give an even more jarring and convoluted third act.Now in must explore the screenplay as a whole. Of the greatest holes in the consistency of this feature is its two concurrent plots. For they are strenuously linked and are left unexplained, this results in headache, confusion and boredom. Nothing is resolved by the end, since there was no real problem at the beginning either, it feels like over two hours of useless meandering just propped up by bad hints to earlier greater works and setting up a future series, and every single film ever made in which isn't focus was to set up more films has been bad. For this film has no describable plot, it's a mess. Unlike other more successful films that have set up a future, such as phase one Marvel or heck even the first Hobbit film, they had discrete narratives of their own, and characters to invest in, this film does not have those fundamentals.The plot-twists of this film are unconvincing and unimaginative and hold no weight other than that hey relate to earlier films. This a lazy trick used by Rowling and is simply bad storytelling. For due to the lack of proper character development or emotional weight, the twists hod, no impact to the audience and thus are simply cheap ploys used by Rowling to try and save the feature, which clearly didn't work on most of the audience.On a technical level, this film holds some good aspects. The sound design and visual effects are for the most part fun and vivid but are fairly standard by modern blockbuster standards. The cinematography though, oh my god, it is terrible. Extreme disorientating closeups then suddenly standard unimaginative angles. It is truly jarring. The colouration is so incredible bland, other than the blue fake dragon at the end, no other image sticks in my head as memorable or even noteworthy or fun. It is almost black and white, so grey and depressing. This doesn't feel like a family friendly fantasy film about fun silly creatures and a Magizoologist, this feels like a fascist take over. If I had children I wouldn't show them this film, its grey, boring and jarring, all things unsuitable for young children over great distances of time.As a result of the abhorrently bland cinematography and colour palette, the costume design, set design, makeup and visual effects all suffer. The image becomes flat, uninteresting, after the last film won the Academy Award (Oscar) for Costume Design, this colouration choice really does an injustice to this achievement, and to the hard work the costume designers must have gone to to trump their previous achievement. Nothing about this films image is good, its truly a mistake and must be fixed if people are to remember any future instalments, or find them fun. For this blandness works against the film, it is not stylish but instead is boring. Not like 'Schindler's List' which was in almost pure B&W which gave the film character or more recently the film 'Her' which used a lot of red hues to heighten the loving and bemused atmosphere. This film has no clear focus as to what its colouration/cinematography was seeking to achieve. For if it seeks to be dark, it belongs not in a film called 'Fantastic Beasts', the pathetic fallacy fails on a fundamental level, the semantic's do not match up. This film sis so confused in so many aspects. Even the score was completely unremarkable and completely forgettable, I cant remember a single part of it. Showing that its only function was to dictate emotion, not to heighten or compliment it as a good score does. 2/10.\n",

            "Review text: In 1927 New York City, evil wizard Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) escapes a prison transport and heads to Paris with his supporters. In London, Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) refuses British Ministry of Magic's command to hunt Grindelwald. It's revealed that it was Albus Dumbledore (Jude Law) who sent Newt to NYC and this time he sends him to Paris. Newt is joined by Jacob Kowalski (Dan Fogler). Tina Goldstein (Katherine Waterston) is already there searching for lost pure-blood wizard Credence Barebone (Ezra Miller) along with everyone else. Her sister Queenie (Alison Sudol) falls under the persuasion of Grindelwald.This has plenty of wizarding whiz bangs. It has too much twisting back-bending back stories. Some of the characters are acting in strange ways. This is overloaded. J. K. Rowling should consider not writing for the novel but concentrate on writing for the movie. There is too much of everything. I don't understand Queenie's dark turn. I hoped that she was playing along but that seems extremely unlikely. For some reason, Tina has turned a lot colder. I didn't understand the significance of Credence at the start which makes his reveal less compelling. This movie follows a dozen main characters which is about six too many. For Potter fans, this is a must but this prequel franchise is not a necessity for casual fans.\n",

            "Review text: As a very passionate fan of the Harry Potter movies and books, I was thrilled when I heard the news about a chance to revisit the magic world again. But after seeing the first fantastic beasts movie, I was not satisfied. Sure, it was cute and all, but it felt disconnected. Although it was fun being introduced to a variety of Scamender's creatures, it was far from the movie I'd expected.Then came this movie. I regret ever stepping in to the theatre to watch it. The whole movie is a complete mess, with too many loose strings, plotless reveals and desperate attempts to draw in the OG Potter-fans. Destroying roots of the Potter-story just to shove characters like McGonagall in our faces (who wasn't even born when she supposedly taught Newt), making Nagini into a person (which totally throws of Voldemort's traits, implying that they at some point meet?) , and botching Dumbledore's complicated relationship with Grinderwald. Not even mentioning the completely derailed characters, weird plot twists and ridiculous cameos from otherwise respected characters (Nicholas Flamel). The story is not even about Newt and his creatures anymore, and Newt is really just a bystander in this story.I could go on for ages about how bad this movie is, but to summarize; Even though this movie came out 2 years ago, I am still mad. If you are a Harry Potter fan, do not watch this movie. It risks the magic of the entire Harry Potter universe.\n",

            "Review title: Inadequate Beasts: The Off-Screen Misdemeanors of Grindelwald\n",
            "Review text: What's it about?Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is the second entry in the Fantastic Beasts Harry Potter spinoff franchise. Directed by David Yates, director of every movie in the Harry Potter universe since Order of the Phoenix, the story is set a year after the previous Fantastic Beasts movie and continues the story of Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) as he attempts to track down the Obscurial Credence (Ezra Miller) before one of several other factions either finds or kills him (if that description doesn't make much sense, don't worry-it doesn't make sense in the movie either). Bringing back Dan Fogler, Alison Sudol, Ezra Miller, and Katherine Waterson from the previous entry, as well as Johnny Depp as Grindelwald, the cast is filled out (or bloated) by the addition of several new faces, including Zoe Kravitz as Leta Lestrange, Callum Turner as Theseus Lestrange, Claudia Kim as Nagini (for some reason), and Jude Law in his highly-anticipated turn as a young Albus Dumbledore, among many others.What works?Almost nothing. I was not expecting this to be a great movie, given the middling quality of the first Fantastic Beasts, but this was a disaster from start to finish. I'll try to be fair and give credit where credit's due, but there's very few positives to be found.Like the first Fantastic Beasts, there is some good acting in among the muddled story and underdeveloped characters. Eddie Redmayne is excellent, if completely wasted in his own movie, while Dan Fogler remains an on-screen delight, and even those two performances only rise to the level of notability because we had a nominal degree of emotional investment in their characters from the first movie. Johnny Depp is also surprisingly solid, toning down his usual antics and actually delivering one really compelling moment (probably the only one in the movie) in a speech/rally scene near the end.The visual effects are mostly solid, if taken on their own, one fiery climactic setpiece almost rising to the level of \"impressive,\" if one discounts the direction, the characters, and the narrative direction involved in creating it.James Newton Howard again wrote the score, and while it certainly doesn't live up to John Williams' legacy, or even that of Alexandre Desplat, who scored both Deathly Hallows parts, it's more than solid, offering several good moments and barely any poor ones.What doesn't work?Where to begin? At the beginning, perhaps. The opening scene is atrociously amateurish. Within half a dozen stationary shots, essentially setting the scene, the audience is already disoriented, and once the action setpiece actually explodes into being, it does so in such a badly-constructed, chaotic manner that I actually had to shut my eyes for a moment. It's possible to construct an action scene in such a way that it feels disorienting while actually being entirely coherent (the original Bourne trilogy offers several such examples). This movie does not achieve that.The disorientation and unclear filmmaking is a trend throughout. The action is consistently poor, usually leaving the viewer totally unclear on the moving parts, while even the slow scenes are filmed either in uninspired medium/wide shots or repetitive closeups, camouflaging where the actors are in relation to each other.There's also plenty of narrative disorientation to go around. Pretty much the entire first two-thirds of the movie is spent introducing new characters at an absurd rate, many of whom we are supposed to care about, but almost none of whom are even remotely developed. The consequence is that even when we are supposed to care about a character, and when that character does actually get a little development, there's too little time and energy for their particular story to carry any weight, so when it comes to a climax the audience is left unfeeling and kind of bemused.Structurally the movie feels sort of like an isolated second act-we are dropped in with a supposed sense of the stakes, the heroes and villains, and the ending is relatively second-act-ish-but functionally it feels like a first act, introducing characters and plot threads at an unsustainable rate.The glut of new characters also has the unfortunate but obvious side effect of crowding out valuable screentime and development for the established characters. Newt Scamander has all the characteristics of an interesting and fairly unique main character, but he's basically ignored the whole movie. There aren't even many beasts, fantastic or otherwise, and those that do appear are mostly unconvincing and unoriginal.Even the Crimes of Grindelwald part of the title is inaccurate. In the original Harry Potter story, Voldemort is built up as a villain from the very beginning. Because he killed Harry's parents and Harry is our clear main character, there's already some emotional stakes involved in seeing him defeated, basically from the beginning. By fleshing out Harry's backstory across the first four books/movies, and by building up the threat that a returned Voldemort truly would represent, we are given a clear sense of how terrifying he truly is. Then, once he returns, we immediately get a sense of his power, of the threat he represents. Grindelwald, by contrast, has no such strong backstory, no such narrative emotional weight associated with his defeat. We got to see him have an anticlimactic final battle at the end of the first Fantastic Beasts movie, we get to see him escape from prison at the start of the second, but we have no sense of how dangerous he really is, nor any particular reason to care about his supposed crimes. Even with his lone good scene, he's not a good villain.There's not even much here for the hardcore Potterheads. Dumbledore in his prime is good. There's a cameo by another fan favorite character which is immensely satisfying. But beyond that, there's nothing actually any good. There is an absurd amount of artificial fan service (did we really need a gratuitous shot of the Sorcerer's/Philosopher's Stone?), almost none of it serving any narrative purpose beyond the superficial, \"Look, I recognize that thing! I'm part of the in-group this movie is shamelessly pandering to!\" There are even several explicit errors or contradictions to the existing mythos, several of them substantial. One of the final twists is patently absurd after even a moment's thought, while several other details are just wrong. One suspects that JK Rowling will be able to find a way to contrive the retcons into making sense, but that doesn't make them any less unsatisfying in-movie.Even the new aspects of the Wizarding World introduced in this movie feel like little one-off ideas Rowling didn't think merited inclusion in the original Harry Potter story. None of the new material is interesting, logical, necessary, or in any way good or exciting.But is it any good?No. There's maybe ten minutes total that range from mediocre to good. The rest is horrific. This is legitimately one of my least favorite movies I've ever seen (a slightly less hyperbolic statement than it seems-I usually only watch a movie if I think I'm going to like it, and I know my preferences well). It's disorganized, disorienting, lacks anything resembling a coherent plot or interesting character work, is an insult to its own mythology, and serves no purpose whatsoever as a self-contained movie. Don't watch this movie, and if you do, out of either morbid curiosity or misplaced loyalty to a fast-fading franchise, wait for it to come to DVD or streaming.What's next?Unfortunately, we're in for three more of these things (assuming this one doesn't tank and kill the franchise, which it almost certainly won't). David Yates is attached to direct all three, the next of which is slated to release on November 20th, 2020. The subsequent entries will continue in two-year intervals. On the bright side, there doesn't seem to be anything else coming down the pipeline from the Harry Potter universe, so there's only a finite amount of damage currently set to be done to the franchise's legacy.\n",

            "Review text: The second installment of Fantastic Beasts, titled Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald picks up shortly after the first where Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) has been captured and is being taken transferred back to the British Ministry of Magic when he manages to escape and take over the carriage in which he is being transported. As the opening scene, this sets the visual standards for the film extremely high. As they are hurdling in the sky on a carriage in a thunderstorm, the tension and excitement build setting the stage for a fantastic film.Newt (Eddie Redmayne) is back at his home, tending to his collection of beasts when he is approached by Dumbledore (Jude Law) to help track down Credence (Ezra Miller). Credence, after the first film, has spent time searching for his mother and who his real family is. He is lost, and alongside Nagini (Claudia Kim), he's searching for a place to belong. With Grindelwald on the loose, Credence is surely his next target for recruitment into his following which seeks to take the superior status over no mags/ muggles and restore pure blood to the wizarding world. Racing against Grindelwald to find Credence, auror, Tina (Katherine Waterston) manages to track down a lead. As Grindelwald works his magic and charisma to convince the wizarding world of his beliefs and goals, friend turns against friend, lines are drawn, and sides are chosen, changing the wizarding world forever.Tackling the infamous wizarding world is no small challenge, but the visuals in this film are nothing short of magical. They work so well to create the perfect atmosphere for our story. From the opening scene to the very end, the visuals bring about an enchanting experience for the audience. I can't get into details without spoiling the ending, but man is it intense. Newt continues to his love and protection of magical creatures in this film, and each one is so spectacularly crafted. The scenes where he is home and taking care of the various creatures is incredible.In this installment, we get a bit more of the backstory of a lot of characters including Dumbledore, Grindelwald, Newt, Leta, and Newt's brother, Theseus Scamander (Callum Turner). The way in which it is handled is exciting; as the film unfolds, we learn more secrets of the families of the wizarding world and gives us more perspective on the origins of our beloved characters of the Harry Potter series.The performances in the film are pitch perfect. Eddie Redmayne continues to stun as Newt Scamander. His gentle, awkward, kind, and loyal nature continue to shine through his character, making you fall in love with his character more each minute. Katherine Waterston, while a decent performance, tends to fall a little flat for me. Jude Law as Dumbledore sounded like a strange casting choice, but after seeing the film, it works so well. Ezra Miller gets better and better every time I see him on screen. No matter what he is doing, he wholly dedicates to a role to bring us the best possible version. As Credence, you feel both empathy and fear for him as he tries to navigate what his life has become at no fault of his own. Zoë Kravitz as Leta is pretty fantastic, and I love where they go with her character in the film.The big question on everyone's mind is how is Johnny Depp? Despite anyone's personal feelings towards him as an actor, it can't be denied that he dives into and disappears in every role he tackles. Grindelwald is no different. He becomes a terrifying, intoxicating, and charismatic leader, hell-bent on manipulating the world to his liking. There are scenes where he will enchant you into almost believing him and the next, he will terrify and appall you.Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald takes the first installment and improves upon it tenfold. In the film, we see a strict division in the wizarding world that is sure to shape the characters in a new way come the next installment. This film is darker, more magical, and more thrilling than the first. It starts big and ends with a bang, sure to delight Harry Potter fans the world over. It is all that we loved about Harry Potter and more, bringing the excitement back to the wizarding world once again. There are tons of little nods to the fans of the original Harry Potter that are hidden in the film, solidifying that this story is indeed what will shape the world we know and love. Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is entirely captivating and leaves us begging for more.\n",

            "Review text: This is an unfortunate film.The acting done for Newt continues to be praisable but the package it's wrapped in is as warped and confused as an Obscurus. Characters behave out of character. The character count is doubled and even fewer of them feel alive. It's great to see Newt and Tina again but just about everyone and everything else was garbled by aimless writing. Was this really written by the same JK Rowling who built Harry Potter? You wouldn't know it unless her name was at the top of the credits.I will not be going to theaters again to see what more of a mess the Potter writers cook up.\n",

I felt asleep twice in the movie which is proven to be a cure for my insomnia. The book to movie adaptation is too far stretched. As far as I recalled the book is like an encyclopedia of magical creatures but the movie adaptation is so complex as to involving Grindewald and Dumbledore's \"it's complicated\" relations and freaky Credence constantly (and angrily) looking for his true identity. It's like adapting Hansel and Gretel and linking them to the chain of events that resulted in World War I.Jude Law is the only good thing in the movie. Depp is like recycling his previous roles as Sweeney Todd/ the vampire in the bomb movie or any other roles where he wore a make-up (ok pretty much all of his movies). Ezra Miller and Eddie Redmayne never belonged in the series at the first place. Save your money muggles..\n",

I really enjoyed this movie, just as much as the first installment. Of course, it is a bit different, and it gets down to serious business, so the tone is a bit darker. Which of course makes sense. There was still enough humor though, and I love the characters. The storyline is great, the villain is interesting, the special effects were amazing, and the history and lore for the Harry Potter series is rich and enjoyable. Although this movie is pretty amazing, it did suffer from trying to feed us a lot of information and history. Yeah, there is a lot to take in, and a lot you find out. Perhaps this movie could've been a bit longer too as some extra scenes between some characters would've been appreciated. But with all of the information and history that was given, I found it all to be pretty exciting. I definitely feel as if this is a definite must see for any Harry Potter fan.\n",

            "Review text: Disclaimer: I never read any of Rowling's works, nor did I watch any of the HP movies. But I did see the last FB movie and have a passing knowledge of the world by dint of it being a cultural meme of today. With that in mind, here are my thoughts on this FB sequel.Newt Scamander is a pretty lousy protagonist. He's meek, socially handicapped, and very wishy-washy in his allegiances for most of the film, and only develops as a character in the last 10-15 minutes. He seems to care about his computer-generated animals more than his friends and family, and generally just moves from place to place without much direction or explanation. Why does he have to take a bucket to teleport to Europe when he can simply use his wand? Why does he spew gold dust around a busy Parisian street and no one walking around tries to confront him? Why does it take until the climax of the film for him to realize Grindelwald is a bad guy and choose a side? It boggles the mind, given how much he features in the film, for there to be so little to grab onto and identify with.Then you have Grindelwald. He goes from menacing to boring pretty quickly. He gets his underlings to do his dirty work, while he... does what exactly? I swear, were it not for his David Bowie-like eyes and stone-faced expression, you would think he was yet another character tacked on to waste the audience's time, like Leta or Queenie and the American fatso.Speaking of characters, there are way too many in this movie. Nest, Newt's brother, the emo kid with hidden powers (who cares?), Leta, Queenie, fatso, middle-aged Dumbledore, Grindelwald, Grindelwald's sidekick, snake girl, Tina, random Parisian guy with an eye parasite, the magic MI6 squad, MI6 hitman who's after emo kid... give me a break, movie. None of these people are interesting or very relatable.And oh man, the CGI. Prepare to get your year's fill of CGI animals, backdrops, teleporting, wands, water; it's too much and it's in every single scene. It's like Sky Captain or Star Wars prequels. It gets to be so boring and run-of-the-mill that you fall asleep, which I did. Neither the comedy nor the action is enough to keep me awake.I came out of this movie utterly floored by how awful it was. I was so anxious for it to be over that when Grindelwald said \"I hate Paris\" at the end of his final scene, I heard a woman laugh in the theater, and I couldn't help joining her. I wanted so badly for there to be something to latch onto and enjoy, but there was nothing.\n",

It feels like a waste of energy, especially knowing that there are plenty of people out there who genuinely enjoy this film series, but I'm just not one of them. I LOVE the Harry Potter movies and grew up with those 8 films, but I've never felt the connection to the Fantastic Beasts series that I did to Potter. It's not necessarily fair to make that comparison but alas, there's virtually nothing good about the Crimes of Grindelwald. Confusing, convoluted, and at times way too convenient for its own good, the film has nothing to grapple onto emotionally. In fact, the one decent thing about the first film (Queenie and Jacob) is entirely ruined in this film's third act. Disappointingly, the film has almost pushed aside the beasts side of the series completely, in exchange for a cliched villain with Grindelwald, who severely lacks in originality. Admittedly, I found myself lost for most of the runtime. Until they inevitably put out \"Cursed Child\" in 15 years, this may be it for me with this universe.2.3/10\n",

In the last one, they all had nice wrap ups to their characters that were completely discarded in the first ten minutes of this one. Newt, based in his character, shouldn't even be in this movie but they force him in. Nice little queenie goes psycho and forces Jacob into marrying her. She then joins Grindelwald thinking he's doing the right thing. SHE CAN READ MINDS but she can't tell he's a bad guy. Ok. They try so hard to make Lita Lestarange a good character. They spend so much time fleshing out her backstory with newt but then fail to do anything with that and kill her off like we're supposed to care about her character. Credence, my least fav character, somehow survives internal combustion and, oh my gosh!, turns out to be dumbledores lost brother!??...absolutely terrible smh. They have other fan service plot twists that are dumb like leta being related to the top hat guy and nagini being a human. Cant wait for these to be over. I wish they'd just make a marauders tv series or focus on Dumbledore instead of this garbage. 4/10. Jude law and Johnny depp were good. Can't say the same about the movie though.\n",

            "Review text: With all the hype surrounding this movie (excellent trailers, Kendrick-curated soundtrack, all-African cast) I thought I was in for something special with Black Panther, as while they aren't remotely the highest quality movies, the Marvel cinematic universe movies are generally pretty entertaining. As it turns out I was wrong, Black Panther was extremely average, I have no idea what these critics/review bots are talking about when they say that it is the best Marvel movie and worthy of \"critical\" praise (as not just a super hero movie but as a movie in general.)Things that I liked:\n",
            "Effort put into aesthetic authenticity of the African elements of the movie - within the Marvel universe the look and feel of the movie was unique and you can tell care was taken in this regard.Andy Serkis - My favorite character by far, was probably the only person who didnt seem like he was reading from a script sheet and got some genuine laughs out of me.Things that I didn't like:\n",
            "The story was extremely predictable and to be honest I don't know if the most virtuous resolution was reached in the climax. Michael B Jordan's character had fairly reasonable intentions for wanting to kill the Black Panther and take his place in Wakanda as he had been abandoned, with seemingly no family, to live in the ghettos of Oakland. However, his whole plan to give advanced Wakandan weaponry to every African person in the world so they could kill and overthrow people in power who weren't African was extremely \"on-the-chin\" in terms of its narrative motivations within the current climate. It wasn't remotely clever or nuanced and really unbalanced his character, his motivations were understandable but his plan was moronic. Additionally, who didn't see Black Panther surviving his fall? Who didn't see the Gorilla tribe coming to the rescue at the end? The entire movie was so bland and predictable I wanted it to be over well before the end - I didn't even stay for the post credit scenes...The acting was very wooden - Not a lot to say here really, some really poor line delivery from the cast across the board except for Andy Serkis. No one was particularly charismatic, the main character for instance was extremely boring.The script was very robotic - This ties into the poor acting, but perhaps as a result of the script, some of the actors never really had a chance to bring their characters to life.The characters - I have already addressed the mess that was Michael B Jordan's character Warmonger(?). Basically throughout the entire movie you never really learn anything or see anything of the Black Panther's character, he basically moves from one place to another showing no emotion and just either smashes things or asks people questions. Apparently the character is supposed to be very intelligent, while it was probably a narrative choice, the Black Panther in this movie seemed like an emotionless Jarhead whose only really characteristic was that he get nervous around his girlfriend... The women in this movie had a bit of attitude and charisma and shouldn't be blanketed down with the Black Panther and Warmonger as bad characters, but they didnt really get a chance to shine and really only contributed a few one liners and a bit of fighting.The action - Shaky-cam rubbish, the action in the movie is terrible and not remotely on the level of the well-choreographed fighting in say Captain America Winter Soldier - please for the love of god show someone getting punched or kicked without having to cut the shot 5 times. There is an action sequence at the start which basically flagposted what the action was going to be like, it is shot at night and you basically cant see bloody anything...The CGI - Honestly, the CGI in Black Panther felt extrmely overused and was surprisingly quite bad. It really took me out of some scenes because the environments and effects looked average (not quite Justice League bad but not far off). It is obvious in scenes in Wakanda, for instance, where the plains/mountains are in the background but they are clearly filming in front of a green screen. Some of the effects just looked silly and got laughs out of me and my party. I personally though the Rhinos were stupid...The Soundtrack - After all the hype surrounding Kendrick Lamar curating a soundtrack for the movie, the tracks from that album barely feature at all. They faintly play from some cars and stuff here and there and a couple feature in some action scenes but I though we would be watching some decent action scenes with some bass heavy Kendrick blasting along to the fighting. Alas, no dice. The orchestral score is also quite average, coming in strong at weird moments and being quite out of place in certain places, there are a couple of moments where it seems like some sort of fairy, Harry Potter, Narnia music that just doesn't fit the scene.Overall I think this is probably one of the weaker Marvel movies, avoiding honest criticism because of the hype surrounding it. The basic components of the film are all poor-average, with the only real 5+/10 aspect being the aesthetics of Wakanda and its people. Like I said above, I wanted to leave well before it was over because I knew the action was probably not going to improve from nauseating shaky-cam and I knew how it was all going to play out.\n",

It's a big shame that other genuine brilliant movies would have missed out on their chance of an award due to this.If it's taught me anything, it's that the Oscars are no longer relevant and should be ignored. Perhaps also many of the major film review sites as the ratings must be artificial, hopefully that gets exposed at some point as it would be questionable ethically if not also false advertising...\n",

Was it my favorite in the MCU? No. Are there people who give it 10 stars just because of the all black cast? Maybe. But 1 Star? Please. That's just Alt-Right spamming.

Both old and young people want to fall in love with the characters in movies - or the opposite for antagonists. In this movie they spend maybe 30 seconds building up the characters, if even that. They just assume that we will have feelings to any character who pops up in the movie - BUT WE DON'T. If anyone fights, almost dies and in the end dies anyways we just do not care since we do not get to know the person. Forrest Whitaker acts is but off yet you do not care if he dies... WHO is he, tell us something about him before please (!).Same thing goes for the rest. Seriously, a movie with 99% effects and 1% emotions is NOT a good balance.AND WHY ARE ALL CHARACTERS 100% STEREOTYPE??PS.

In general, this movie is fine, as I have stated earlier, but the truth is that the professional critics have judge this movie for the wrong reasons, they have let their political interests overshadow their ability to rate a movie the way it's supposed to be.In conclusion, this movie is completely overrated, also, definitely not the best movie of the year, not even in the top ten, not even the best movie of superheroes of this year and even though the academy nominated it for best picture it is still overrated. If you want to watch a really good superheroe movie and a really good movie in general I suggest The Dark Knight not Black panther.\n",

Although It trys to grasp at the idea of western colonialism and racism, it only scratches the surface never really deciding were it stands. Although this has been championed as one of they greatest diverse films it is not and I would recommend you to check out '12 years a Slave' , 'Get Out' or 'Moonlight' who do a much better job than this meager attempt. The plot is by the numbers the direction is nothing special. Chadwick Boseman's acting is rather stilted and you can never attach to his character. Michael B Jordan is a one note villian who also struggles, phoning in a performance spouting monologues about messages that never really click. But where the movie really falls on its face is the third act which is cgi heavy and looks like its out of a video game. Black Panther by no means is terrible its below average and the concept of Wakanda is an excellent and well excuted idea. But this movie just needs to go that little bit deeper and seprate itself from the tired superhero formula.\n",

Not going to happen. For me there is so much effort to preach (as that's what it is) a particular political viewpoint that it totally interferes with story and character development. Because of this I found Black Panther almost unbearable and struggled to make it to the end. Besides that, technically the CGI was wayyyy off and character development severely compromised. Just awful. Possibly the most undeservingly overhyped movie of all time.\n",

I feel that the critics are afraid to tell the truth about this film because it certainly does not deserve a 98% rating on RT. It's sad that our society cannot be honest about ratings due to fear of ostracization. Usually Marvel heroes use humor to charm the audience, but the Black Panther uses old, worn out cliched formulas. Although it's not a terrible film ,it is certainly not deserving of anything over 50%. There were too many negative racial overtones, and I believe Marvel/Disney need to keep their political ideologies out of the moves. THe visuals were good, but the story line got lost.\n",

Perhaps it was the expectation that undermined the enjoyment?The genre is a little hard to quantify, but it reminded a lot of Wonder Woman. Except, instead of the WW2 setting, we had a kind of Bond-style thriller instead, complete with ridiculous gadgets and under-developed baddies.The film looks great (some dodgy CGI aside) - I liked the armour, weaponry and cultural aesthetics. I also felt a lot of the performances were quite compelling. Unfortunately, it is all rather dull. And doesn't feature anything we haven't seen before. What is most disappointing, is that it doesn't seem to tie into the Marvel continuity at all (apart from the unremarkable Everett Ross, who appeared from nowhere in Civil War and is a poor attempt to replace Agent Coulson). Like Wonder Woman, this is simply a \"Black Panther tale\" and you can take it or leave it when embarking on your next Marvel marathon.I also found the advanced technology to be completely over the top. Weapons and armour, I can understand. Miracle healing and Panther suits concealed within necklace teeth is VERY hard to swallow indeed. Vibranium was an indestructible Alien metal that could absorb sound. Fair enough. Great material for weapons and armour. But spaceships and miracle healing? Really? Couldn't we have toned it down just a little?I was bored. My friend was bored. After his wonderful debut in Civil War, this was a bit of a wasted opportunity.\n",

            "Review text: First, this movie has a lot of pointless scenes that achieve nothing, the museum scene with pointless covert operation ending up in killing everyone anyway, that's so not Silent Assassin. The 007 Bond casino scene was just there to establish the most worthless character in movie history - Everett K. Ross. After the capture of Klaue (surprisingly surviving a horrible car crash), we get another pointless scene where Killmonger and his girlfriend re-capture Klaue just to kill him again for no reason. Killmonger never actually needed Klaue in the first place, so killing him was as pointless as freeing him out. Killmonger also kills his GF for no particular reason yet again. He could've easily get to Wakanda anyway since he has the royal tattoo (they also gave those to vampire servants in Blade). Then Killmonger and Black Panther participate in previously established variety of local Mak'Gora (election process I guess). Black Panther fails miserably and the new stronger king takes the throne, the end, right? No. They actually want you to root for the most useless and impotent king ever. Killmonger then says something stupid about colonization and oppression, and decides to use the Vibranium weapons (produced solely by a 16 y.o. girl mastermind) to conquer the world. So he's like pro-anti-colonization or something, you tell me. Yet he is betrayed by his people (Okoye literally says she will stay loyal to the king and in 5 minutes betrays the new king) and they all happily participate in a civil war slaughter until Killmonger gets killed. Also love how they intercepted their own ships with their own people, just murdering them. There was also some sort of brother betrayal, but it was so shallow and lacking motivation that it isn't really worth discussing. The brother (I think) wanted to have some more action and so he betrayed the king just to lower his weapons and suffer a life sentence afterwards. After slaughtering his own people, everything gets back to normal. And the king who solves all problems with violence decides to share his tech and knowledge to help the world. But not like the whole world, mostly African-american people in the US. I'm sure it's going to be pretty easy, since all technology in this world is done by one genius girl.Then we get the first post-credit scene when BP visits the UN assembly and says that he is ready to share the knowledge with all the nations. I'm pretty sure that we already have a lot of knowledge on slaughtering each other in wars and even civil wars, so his knowledge is not going to make a great difference.Summing it up, we get a weak impotent king to hold his throne. He never cared about anyone besides himself really, the fact that he suggests to heal Killmonger who killed Zuri just for lulz shows that he doesn't care. He never cares about his own people since he never hesitated on killing them personally. Just a little advice, if you wan't to have a good king character, ask Llane Wrynn how to rule.Killmonger was driven by revenge at first, then his motivation turned into some uncertain political position about oppression, but in the end it seems that he just loved his country (but not the people, it seems). The scene where BP suggests that Killmonger can be saved and healed completely destroys all the rivalry and the motivation of both. Anyway, Killmonger and Klaue were the best characters in the movie. The story was nonsense, they achieved nothing , BP leaned nothing and is still a worthless king and a bad leader. Was nice to see Serkis having a lot of fun in this movie, I love that guy and I'd love to see more of him (guess he's tired of playing CGI puppets...Gollum...Gollum).I also loved all the wishful thinking in this movie, which is mostly based on the comic I guess. Advanced native African people with space technology saving the world? Any educated person would suggest you checking South Africa after 1994. Supporting the immigrants in the US? Come on, guys...The good stuff: even though there were just 3 sets of Wakanda I still kinda loved it, the music choice was good, showing all that traditionalism, the nature. Killmonger's scene with his father was gold, I wish we had more dramatic scenes (it was well acted and well executed overall). The sister was kinda cool sometimes, being a more modern character and rejecting the old ways. Even though she's a little too much Mary Sue.Yet the main reason why I still decided to write this is the reviews. This has to stop. And I'm not talking solely about RT 97% which is just ridiculous. It's like people are afraid to judge something impartially cause of getting shamed for being racist or something. Also, this movie started with fair 7.1 on IMDB later to be loaded with >30% of 10 ratings eventually ending up in 7.9 (as of now, I'm sure it will only go up). I'm not saying that IMDB has something to do with this, but this rating surely does not reflect the quality of the movie.Conclusion: don't trust ratings (nor RT or IMDB). If you like it - like it, if you don't - no need to be afraid to say that you didn't like it.You know you've seen a good movie when you exit the theater with something changed inside, an emotion, a thought - BP is not such a movie.\n",

I couldn't connect with any of the characters and as such cared little for their success or failure. Much of the hype I believe is due to the dominant African American cast. That's fine, when I watch a movie I don't care what colour people are, but in this case the hyper seems to have heavily depended on that fact and ignored more important aspects of a movie like storyline etc. The lead character was rather bland. Wait for this movie on netflix or something. I gave this movie 3 stars because Andy Serkis was funny\n",

            "Review text: Ahhh here we go again, another Marvel film. And I know I'm probably going to annoy a lot of people but, this is my review and if people disagree good for them. Disappointing, great potential and I really, really wanted to like it but... I didn't. One of the most loved characters in the marvel universe butchered. In the comics T'Challa is portrayed as an intelligent and most importantly a serious character; however, if I were to meet him in real life I wouldn't have a clue what he'd be like, unlike almost any other marvel character such as Iron man, Captain America and even Ant Man etc. The protagonists in the film are undeveloped and this is most obvious when you compare them to the villains that are shown to have a political standing and given such a rich personality over everybody else, when the audience can relate and connect to the villains more so than the protagonists the audience can't drive and support for the good guys; like most other superhero films. Don't get me wrong the villains are shown as such but the lack of character from the protagonists leaves a sour taste is one's mouth, especially since black panther is such a great character in the marvel franchise. I loved the concept of the film, Africa is a great place to branch out into a new franchise of superhero's as well as villains; with a rich and interesting culture so rarely used in all superhero's films. I was really engrossed and absorbed with Michael B Jordan's character \"Warmonger\" and his political beliefs, compared to the protagonists his point of view was relatable as he had experienced the outside world and been formed by it just like us he was an outsider who wished to be a part of this futuristic and successful culture. However, the film lacked to drive home why his political stance was wrong, and how T'Challa's new approach will further benefit the world; I mean buying up properties in less developed parts of California is great but it was never really made clear to the audience (I mean me, and people less-smarter than me) what this was for. And you'd think for a film with an age rating of 12A, with such strong political elements would make it coherent what his solution was. Don't even get me started on the CGI, completely ridiculous and over used. Some elements were so unrealistic e.g. war rhinos who are able to target out their 'enemies', who are also meant to be their allies. if you've seen it think about it, weird right? One of the biggest things was the character T'Challa, who as I've mentioned is an amazing and really cool character, he is also rated to be sixth 'most intelligent' character in the marvel universe however on the big screen he was no-where near what he was meant to be, it was like he was a completely different character in the films; I don't want to sound like a comic book nerd, I love it when characters change in films but this is a completely new person with almost no similarities other than his name. I feel he didn't grow into a King instead he simply changed his political view which is a shame because why couldn't he do both. Worth a watch, but make your own opinion I mean I'm only a film student. Oh and who the hell cared when Forest Whitaker's character died because I certainly didn't, trying to make it like an important characters death, when actually we'd only seen him twice before.\n",

I am a huge fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and was hoping this film would be good.The story is like any other superhero film story. The Wakanda aspect of the film is great. The technology used in the film is good. But there are a lot of clichés that kinda ruin the film.The acting is okay. Chadwick Boseman performs the best. Lupita Nyong'o, Martin Freeman, Danai Gurira, and Forest Whitaker perform below standard. Michael B. Jordan plays a generic and clichéd villain. He performs the worst.The action if very good, but the films pacing is terrible. The film starts off fast but comes to a halt halfway through. The runtime is very overlong as well.Pros: Chadwick Boseman's performance, good action, cool tech, and WakandaCons: Generic storyline, okay acting, Michael B. Jordan as a generic villain, terrible pacing, and an overlong runtime.Overall Rating: 4.5I really wanted this film to be good, but it felt like an overlong, clichéd, and dull film that was not needed in the MCU.\n",

            "Review text: That's how important is was for me to explain my thoughts on this movie. Super disappointed in this one. I say disappointed because I was really excited to see a great Super Hero movie with real Cultural cues. Unfortunately, that didn't happen.Cultural Cues: MISSED\n",
            "It wasn't clear if this movie was endorsing Black American culture or African culture. No, they are not one-in-the-same. The futuristic Wakanda has graffiti on the walls (American Street Art) as well as tribal African painting that is chipped (is it impossible for paint to stay fresh in Africa?) and there are street merchants selling hand-woven baskets (fits the \"tribal\" scene, but not exactly the advanced technology city they were trying to illustrate).Music seemed odd and try-hard. In a movie celebrating black culture, I was expecting some amazing, compelling bass-heavy, Kendrick-themed action scenes. Instead, we got typical Super Hero theme music with a snare added to it. Acting & Character Development: MOSTLY OKMichael B Jordan gave an excellent, powerful performance as Killmonger. His physique was massive and he was extremely compelling in comparison to other movies I've seen him in. Unfortunately, as a villain, it wasn't clear if we were rooting for him or against him. His character definitely displayed Leadership and strength that T'Challa (Black Panther) was lacking. I kinda wanted Killmonger to change his ways and become the permanent leader.Klaue, played by Serkis was also excellently well executed. But again, he was still pretty likable. No villain to hate means so protagonist to root for.Jabari tribe... what? Seemed more like the black fraternity Omega Psi Phi with their barking and mindless (and unexplainable) barbarism in an advanced societyStoryline & Message: EXTREMELY CONFUSINGIs the motivation political, or revenge? Is colonization good or bad? Is this a black/african versus white movie, or a weak versus power movie? Why is the king of the country determined by the best fighter? Is Wakanda advanced, or tribal? both? Alien precious metal, but no Foreign Affairs policies? Is opening an outreach center in the ghetto really enough Social Responsibility initiative for the most advanced society ever?\n",

I think this deals with a more complex subject like Pan-Africanism in an interesting setting. The soundtrack and costumes were both very enriching. Klaue seems to be a key villain early on, but this quickly shifts as Killmonger becomes the main threat. This complicates the surface level conflict of Wakanda vs. the outer world, as Killmonger has Wakandan roots. Anyone claiming that Killmonger was superficial is clearly biased, considering he's up against incredibly bland characters in other Marvel films like Thanos, Ultron, and Loki. I saw this in Oakland and it is probably my favorite movie-in-theaters experiences ever.\n",

First impressive thing I noticed was its rich attention to detail in world building and its characters. My only criticism, I would have like to have seen more of the Killmonger character, as I feel they didn't go far enough with him. Over-all, this is a fun and enjoyable movie with action, comedy, drama. There are some complex social political overtones mixed in, but it never feels heavy handed, and I feel that the over-all message is positive for humanity as a whole. If this type of movie isn't your cup of tea, fair enough, but if you are on the fence about watching due to pre-conceived notions about its content and message, I would recommend you give it a try, and I think you will be pleasantly surprised.\n",

That can teach some woman that you don't need a man to survival and much lest to father a child.

However, the film is such as disaster that it made me reconsider \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" and \"Darker\". While the first one was somehow interesting as it is the one establishing the story, characters and tone, and the second one was an extremely hilarious experience thanks to the public in the cinema who shot joke after joke about it, the third left me with a bitter taste of hollowness and nothingness. Even the other people in the cinema were feeling irritated and bored; about 20 minutes into the film they started walking in and out of the cinema hall. They had a moment, I guess, when they wanted to leave but remembered they had payed for the tickets. Really, it was no fun, no thrilling, no sexy and sure as hell not climactic. It was a bore with loose narrative threads and sex scenes as fillers.The supposed challenges the protagonists must face are laughable. First, there comes a flirtatious woman behaving in inappropriate ways towards Christian. Mmm...interesting, I thought! Then Ana knocks her down in a 40-second dialogue. Ok... I wonder what's next, what this new woman is up to, what Christian will do etc. Well, nevermind, we don't get to see her again except in a short scene hugging Eliot. Problem solved. \n",
            "After a \"Fast & Furious\" break, there seems to be a newer problem: Jack Hyde. There's some threatening and guns, we don't really know his motives and they really don't matter as long as the scenes drag the film further. No one cares anyway. It was not until very close to the film's ending that I truly felt the way it failed. When Ana wakes up in hospital, Christian tells her, with wet eyes, something like \"I thought I lost you\" and that's when everyone in the cinema bursted laughing.\n",

            "Review text: Yes, we can all agree about the lack of a solid plot, but other than that, when it comes to the acting, the romance, the chemistry, come on, it's gonna be each to their own and beauty in the eye of the beholder, etc. A poor rating won't erase the fact that this movie took my breath, brought me to tears, and got me so excited my stomach was literally going to be blow up. The romance between Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan is the best I've ever seen in any movie in my entire life bar none. It's romance on such a totally higher level that apparently so many people can't even comprehend it, so they keep taking jabs. The Fifty Shades trilogy is truly a new subgenre of romance in its own right.Actually, when the three movies are taken together, the trilogy becomes much more than the sum of its parts and the story does look solid and beautiful. A virgin English literature student meet a 27-year-old billionaire and he introduces her not just to sex but a very particular kind of sex, for that matter. Anastasia struggles to navigate how possessive Christian becomes sometimes. They fall in love, break up, get back together, face more challenges, get married, face even more challenges, have a baby.The funny thing is, it sounds much more like real life than most other romance movies. Maybe that's why people hate it.And the filmmaker made a thrilling and titillating masterpiece out of it nonetheless.It's extraordinary romance for extraordinary audiences, and that's fine by me. And it's gonna go down in history as the most enchanting romance movie ever.\n",

I love how it's very detailed, and shows off the contrast between Anastasia and Christian's relationship in the first movie versus the final chapter. The acting was fantastic as usual, I love how they got closer as the time passed. Some scenes really melted my cold heart, and the final scene couldn't have been done anything better! The whole trilogy itself is carved deeply in my heart. \n",
            "In addition, I would like to point out that I've been reading different reviews on these movies and I realized that opinions are very very different. I would just recommend that if you don't really seem to be into this kind of movies, don't watch the trilogy. There's no point in stating that the movies are ''garbage'' etc. That's only one person's opinion, which doesn't mean that it's junk in general. For me it was fascinating! For some people, it was disappointing. That's completely fine, but don't throw shade on something only because you didn't like it. I felt like I needed to write that. Hope that all of you who watch it like it as much as I did. Enjoy!\n",

            "Next the plot. The villain out for revenge was a refreshing bit of action but that's about it. The Hollywood messaging is very irresponsible. Christian clearly tells Anastasia he is not ready for fatherhood. Anastasia conveniently 'forgets' to take her birth control, getting pregnant. When he tells her this is grossly unfair and he absolutely is not ready to be a parent, she lashes out at him saying \"that's what happens when you have sex you get pregnant!\". Um, no, actually, if you are responsible about birth control that does not happen 99% of the time. When you force a life altering change on your partner - that's sociopathic and plain nasty. \n",

I wouldn't watch them for the longest time because I thought they were just nasty bdsm movies. I decided to give the first one 20 minutes, and I must say I'm really glad I did.

Other than that, the movie had nothing to offer.The story jumped from pointless scene to pointless scene with no real plot. My wife, who has read the books, was apoplectic at all of the connective tissue that was omitted. The build-up to the big finish was nonexistent. It was almost like the director said, Okay, it's time to do a car cash. Wait, we need to do a sex scene. Let's throw in a bar scene. Hold on, we need another sex scene. This was Twilight Light with even less of a point.\n",

            "Review text: 50 Shades Freed wraps up the trilogy in a satisfying if unsurprising way. Christian and Anastasia carry their relationship to the logical conclusion for many people in love - they marry. For dramatic tension, the characters of Christian and Anna tackle a number of issues which beset people in wedded bliss, including Christian's desire to control Anna versus Anna's desire for independence. Unfortunately, many of the best scenes have been spoiled by placing them in movie trailers - if you've seen the trailers, you can already figure out several important and pivotal plot points. To be fair, 50 Shades Freed was obviously a labor of love for each person involved. The actors all go above and beyond, and the direction and editing are more than adequate. The movie will not appeal to everyone, nor should it. However, the amount of hate and low ratings seen on Fandango, on Rotten Tomatoes and on lMDB is a testament to the number of minds in modern society \n",

Watch what you want - but try to keep an open mind, because most cinematic projects involve thousands of man hours of work, planning and execution. The end result is never assured - but everyone has a dream, and sometimes that dream is shared by others - the fans. Don't tell us what art is. Don't tell us what NOT to enjoy, and we'll try to do the same. Chipper F. Xavier, Esq.\n",

If you enjoy watching a scantily-clad attractive young woman having a good time, then this film is for you ; but if you don't, don't go and watch it just to write a negative review. If you want more graphic sex, I'm told there are Internet sites ; if you want realism, watch the news.This instalment sees Anastasia growing up and becoming more independent, while Christian has to learn to deal with it. Compared to the other two films, there is more non-naked mutual enjoyment ; and also a little drama to keep them busy, and help them to mature.I came out of the cinema feeling happy ; and if we agree with P.T. Barnum, then it deserves credit.\n",

WHAT? They took a lion and turned him into a kitty cat! What a sloppy trilogy. It was like Christian Grey didn't even exist. There was nothing fierce about him. Instead they want to take meek and mousy Anastasia and try to turn her into some bad-ass and it fails...horribly....A badly done character swap of epic proportions. Ruined the entire trilogy for me. Not to mention the sloppy story line. The villain was in foster care along with Grey, and was stricken with insane jealousy at his privileged adoption. HOW BORING. Same story-line from Blades of Glory, from the cut scenes! Worst $40 ever spent, seeing this garbage movie. They screwed Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson. I bet they are glad it's done and over with.\n",

            "Review text: As much as I enjoy this movie (and as an animator/storyartist I love the visuals!) I have to honest and say it is a bit of an unfocused mess. The reason why you should see this movie is because it is the first in what will hopefully be a trend of innovative and creative animated movies that aren't just looking over the shoulders of what Disney and Pixar are doing. This movie is its own creature and I think it deserves to be seen just for the visuals and the opportunity to hopefully support this trend...However, I would only say that if the movie has some substance to it.... which it does. I recommend people see this movie, but it should be noted that I think this movie may be getting the \"Kubo\" treatment where an animated film is visually impressive to such a degree that people gloss over bad writing because everything they are looking at is so cool.The first half of this movie is brilliant. I think just about everything in the first half works really well and is super effective. Miles Morales felt like a real kid with some real kid issues, Peter B Parker was funny, tragic and fleshed out, and Gwen... existed (we'll get to her later). My eyes were glued to the screen and I was excited for where the story would go as I was genuinely surprised at a couple twists and turns in the story.Then, a certain moment happened in the movie where I was taken out of the film and went, \"Wait... oh shoot this is going downhill real fast.\" It was the introduction of all of the other spider-verse characters. At that moment the film shifted gears into an entirely different film from the first half. Does Miles Morales fit in with the professionals? Can Miles Morales impress them? Everyone seems to hate him due to his lack of experience! Can Miles Morales take a leap of faith (which he already did in the beginning of the movie)??!?! Is Miles Morales even relevant to the story?!?!?!?! All of these sudden new themes and plot developments completely derail what the first half of the film was setting up to such a degree that it felt like a giant schism cut through the film and the second half of the film was waving goodbye to the first half.I'll be clear that I have no issue with other spider-verse characters sharing screen-time in the film, the issue is that they don't add much in terms of character development or interaction with Miles. The characters should serve to help Miles grow, but in this movie they just seem like another pair of fists to punch bad guys, and there is no better example of this than...Gwen Stacey.Gwen Stacey has the unfortunate issue of being completely irrelevant to the story when she should be an important and vital character to Peter B Parker's/Miles Morales' character growth and should have an arc of her own. This is a character who witnessed Peter Parker (her best friend) die and Peter B Parker is someone who witnessed Gwen Stacey die in her universe! WHY DON'T THEY DISCUSS THIS!!! Peter B Parker should be surprised and excited to see someone he knew as dead alive again and she should be happy to see her best friend once more! Instead, the two characters just... punch bad guys... like everyone else. No growth or development between the two.To make matters worse, Gwen doesn't even really work to help Miles Morales develop as a character. In the beginning of the film she is built up to be one of the main characters, but in the second half she doesn't develop any further than she did in the beginning. She experiences no character growth nor does she help develop any other characters. She just exists in the film.I could go on for a while about all of the different weird pacing issues in the second half of the film such as Miles Morales suddenly getting super powerful and skilled out of nowhere (it's odd that people complain about \"Mary Sues\" in film but don't complain about Miles Morales going from zero to hero in one scene), or a single cut from a comedy scene to a tragic \"friends splitting up\" scene, some loose character threads such as Miles' dad telling cops to chase spider-man but we never see them do it, and many other instances of odd pacing choices and poor juxtapositions of emotional story beats.But, I will end this on a positive note: All of the characters are enjoyable when they get their moment and I think the writing on the father was really good. He wasn't your typical \"larger than life\" father but a very honest, strong, but stubborn dad who has his flaws yet is very likable and reasonable. I wish him and Uncle Aaron had some scenes together and their dynamic was a bit more fleshed out, but as is I still like them regardless of the additional scenes they deserved.Go see it if you want to support innovative and risky animation, but be warned that it is not a perfect film (other than visually).\n",

You feel his struggles and the pressure that he has to face in his life, with his parents, him releasing that his uncle is working for KingPin, living up to Peter Parker and Gwen and all the other spider people's expectations. You real feel for him. As for Peter Parker, I didn't like that they killed off Peter Parker from this universe at the start of the movie and then another version of Peter just comes up immediately after that. It kinda ruins the death and sadness a little. I would have liked it more if they had a couple more scene or maybe a one day jump before introducing the new spider man. But that's just me. After the Peter J. Parker, was introduced everything just kicked in from there. The whole sequence with Peter and Miles breaking in and out of that lab was wonderfully entertaining and Gwen's entrance couldn't be better. The other spider people introduced later were less useful aside from looking cool and having some memorable moments.Have I talked about the animation yet? it's freaking amazing and watching this actually inspired me to work on some of my art projects that I have been putting off. From the details of the sky scrapers to the reflections and the whole climatic battle scene at the end is just beautifully done and just really really good and satisfying to look at.Overall, the plot, the characters, the animation and the Stan Lee (oh, yes that was good too. Rest in peace Stan Lee, the line he delivered was also really funny and emotional as well) were just spectacular and amazing (see what I did there) and I definitely recommend this movie, even if you're not a Spiderman fan, watch it please. We need a sequel to for this movie. My hope on Sony has been restored.\n",

            "Review text: I was very lucky as my son and I just got to see the movie before it comes out. I was very impressed. The animation work alone was some of the most impressive work I have ever seen. Thencolorations, and fluidity of movement made a comic book come to life as a motion picture. Props to the soundtrack it was great edgy New York hip Hop in places, heck even works St. Elmo's fire in. I was surprised at the excellent humor throughout.Technically as an older male my knowledge of Spider Man was confined to the classic Peter Parker line. I didn't know of this multiverse. But seeing is believing and it all made sense in the film. I had no idea Spider Ham existed but you will love his parts.I don't and won't spoil the story line but as you can imagine good vs bad many excellent fight scenes. Dr. OC and Kingpin battle the several spider people. If you like animated movies, Marvel comics, go see this movie FYI stay all the way through the credits for a very funny finale.\n",

            "Review text: I knew that this movie would be good from the first moment I heard about it last year, and it did not disappoint me one bit. It met all of my expectations, and then went above and beyond them. The animation is a blend of CGI, stop animation, pop/comic book art and realism. The vibrant colors pop out at you, and the action sequences really enthrall. A very captivating and beautiful piece of art is this movie, and the writing choices leave nothing to be desired. The story is that of the traditional starting superhero with a bunch of twists thrown in. The movie itself actually follows past comics for the most part, with some minor changes here and there. A true Spider-Man, or comic book fan in general, will not have anything to criticize in this movie. Everything that fans want to see out of Spidey(s) is in this movie. There are multiple different variations of Spider-Man in the film, and all of them have their special moments to shine. The end credit scene just rockets this movie up past my already positive expectations, and it gets a 10/10 from me! The movie can be enjoyed by both young and old alike, and trust me, it will blow your mind! Best animated film of 2018, and one of the best superhero movies ever made. It deserves any and all awards and kudos it will surely garner.\n",

Miles is awesome and comes with a lot of emotions. Bring the tissues for this one! The best Spider-Man story that has been told yet with stellar voice acting and script.

This movie understands what Spider-Man means to people and and the universe it's build. The story features Miles Morales a character never seen in a movie before and it's captures his personality straight from the comics. The movie also features Peter Parker as a side character to make room for a new Spider-Man and I love this part of the story and how it introduces so many characters but doesn't feel crowded. The animation is also very beautiful, fluid and unique you'll never be bored. It's also very funny for kids of all ages to enjoy. It doesn't Matter your interested in comics or animation or comedy or a heartfelt super hero movie this movie is a great flick for all ages you should definitely see.\n",

If you're really that bothered by a black Spider-Man in this movie then why are you here reading reviews? You still have the Rami films and heck you still have the Garfield films if that's what floats your boat. If you really care about good storytelling and good animation then hear me out.\n",
            "Into the Spider-Verse is the hour of redemption for Sony's animation studio. I haven't been particularly happy with their recent films ranging from endless Hotel Transylvania sequels, constant remakes of the Smurfs, and of course the god awful Emoji Movie. I kept asking myself, when Sony? When will you actually use your creative talents and give us something worth our time? And folks, this is it. This is their baby. Into the Spider-Verse is not only one of the best animated films of the year, it's one of the best Spider-Man films period. I was skeptical at first too, the high ratings, the complex story, the studio, but thankfully the reviews were right on this. What this movie does so well is how it constantly engages its audience through visual storytelling. It reflects the same methods Stan Lee/Steve Ditko used when they wrote their comic stories all those years ago. You can tell the filmmakers did their homework and really captured the comic book esthetic to a whole other level. It's colorful, it's full of amazing textures, and the action is just amazing to watch. Now if the movie solely relied on this I probably would've given it a lower rating but thankfully they wrote a nice story here. We get to finally see Miles Morales come to life and while I didn't think he had the most interesting personality compared to say Peter Parker, he worked as a vessel for the audience. We got to see his Spider-Man journey in a very unique and interesting way that feels nostalgic but fresh at the same time. I do have to add that I didn't quite feel the emotional weight in this film with Miles' character arc like I did in Tobey's Spider-Man 2, but it was still emotionally satisfying for this film on its own when you don't compare it to previous films. In the end, this was still my favorite Spider-Man movie since Spider-Man 2. It's funny, fun, and full of heart. I would be ok with Sony owning the license to Spider-Man if they kept making movies with this animation style but still carry some depth and passion in the storytelling. Because this movie honored the most endearing thing about Spider-Man's story, and it's that anyone can wear the mask. It's that universal trait that Steve Ditko and Stan Lee created all those years ago that make this character so mythological and so palpable. And this has one of Stan's best cameos yet I promise you that. If you're a Spidey fan, or just a comic fan, or even just a fan of animated films. YESSS GO SEE IT. This is my favorite animated film of the year, if not in years, and might potentially creep into my top 10 films of the year. PLEASE GO SUPPORT THIS. 9/10.\n",

As a crazy comics fan (both Japanese comics and American comics), the expression of this movie undoubtedly wins my heart. At first I was a little worried about the fusion of 3-D and 2-D and lower frames, the finished movie completely removes my worry, even I prefer this form than common animation! At the beginning of the movie, I was not into the mood of it and felt kind of strange. Then getting used to it, I felt like I was in a huge comic book. Every scene's just so fascinating, like a page of a comic book. Of course if you are more used to reality TV shows and movies, you may not like this expression XD.The fusion of comics in this movie, to a certain extent, is a supplement for limitation of 3-D animation. It is hard to directly (visually) show the inner side of a scene in a pure 3-D animation. The word it posts, the switching color it shows, extremely enhance the sense in that scene, such as the shot part. I think Disney's 3-D animation is more and more pursuing the sense of reality, and it is sophisticated to copy the sense of exaggeration, which is easily conveyed in a 2-D animation movie. Hope that more companies can consider more innovative expression of animation, instead of making orthodox animations all the time.Back to the movie itself, under excellent background music, the narrative, the pace, the characters and emotional expressions are great, better than some superhero movies. The main topic is absolutely \"Expectations\", and the whole movie clings close to it. Miles yearns for Spider-Man and shoulders expectations from his mates. Conflicts between father and son, Peter and MJ are solved in the end. The description of growing, friendship, family and love is very touching, thanks to excellent music and pace-controlling.Somehow I perceive kind of shadow of Japanese animation, don't know it is my illusion or because of Peni Parker XD. I think Sony is suitable for this kind of movies.As defects, maybe this kind of expression is not suitable for some audiences. Such as dizziness in the background, I'm fascinated by this unique style personally, but I find some people think it makes them dizzy. And the plot in the middle part is kind of disfluent and averaged.And, hardly count it as a defect, the final fight is so so so gorgeous and extraordinary! I was completely captured by the switching color in the background and could not focus on the fight! (My bad!!)In general, I really adore this movie and hope you all guys can watch it!\n",

            "Review text: This movie was outstanding! After seeing The Emoji Movie last year, I had low expectations for any Sony movie coming out. After I found out this movie was coming out, I was nervous. Being a Marvel fan at heart, I didn't like the idea of a Marvel movie being put in the hands of Sony. After watching the trailers, I got more hopeful and decided I would check it out. And boy am I glad I did. This movie is one of my favorite animated movies of all time. Let's start with my favorite part of the movie, the animation. I absolutely loved the idea of an animated movie being told as a comic book. It was so colorful. Sure it was a bit blurry at times (once to the point where my friend thought we went to the 3D version on accident) but it made up for it. The part where the glass breaks from the building was beautiful. And Kingpin's body was hilarious. 10/10 for animation. Next, storyline. It was a pretty good story line, but it could've used a bit more work. The beginning was a bit confusing but I would say I was just about as confused as Miles was. One cliché thing though was that if the rest of the Spider people didn't get back to the universe they would disintegrate. Very funny Marvel, very funny. One thing that was really shocking was how(SPOLIER ALERT!!!!!!!) Aaron was secretly Prowler. That shocked the heck out of me. I liked Kingpin's motivation, but I could point it out a mile away. 8/10 for storyline. Last but not least, characters. I personally really enjoyed the characters. I loved that some of the Spider characters got a chance at the big screen. Miles was my favorite by far. I also enjoyed that they had a different version of Peter Parker. The middle-aged, overweight, divorced side of him. I wished they would do a bit more character development for the other characters though. 9/10 for characters. One last thing. I found it really touching that they did a tribute to Stan Lee and Steve Ditko after the credits. They would be very proud of this movie.\n",

            "Review text: I've waited 4 years to love Spider-Man this much. From comics to movies to video games, the last Spider-Man related story that I truly loved was the divisive Marc Webb movie, The Amazing Spider-Man 2. However, 2018 has really turned things around for my favorite Marvel superhero; from his groundbreaking video game for the PS4 to the brilliant Nick Spencer taking the reigns from the incompetent Dan Slott in the comics. Hell, even the MCU's depiction of Spider-Man (Which I despised in both Civil War and Homecoming) was surprisingly enjoyable in Infinity War, despite my thoughts on the rest of the film. The resurgence in quality Spider-Man stories continues with Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse; perhaps the best superhero film since 2004's Spider-Man 2.The voice cast couldn't have been better. I've been saying how Shameik Moore would make a perfect Miles Morales ever since I saw him in Dope and he doesn't disappoint here. Much like Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn or J.K Simmons J.J Jameson, Shameik Moore IS Miles Morales as far as I'm concerned. He nails Morales ambition, his selflessness, his emotional vulnerability and his overall shyness in one of my favorite comic book movie performances ever. You could not have picked a better actor for this role.Jake Johnson as an older, more broken (But still witty) Spider-Man who's lost his way was unexpected, but really interesting. Johnson is funny and charismatic, but has a real emotional pathos to him that takes his performance to the next level. He may actually be my favorite cinematic acting performance for Peter Parker He's a surprisingly complex character for a more family-targeted Spider-Man film and Johnson handles Parker's ascent from washed up has-been to the Spidey we all know and love wonderfully.Nicolas Cage as Spider-Man Noir is a joy to listen to whenever he's on screen. His deliciously hammy New York accent firing off witty 1930s one liners is something never knew I needed so badly. I found myself smiling pretty much every time he spoke. It's a smaller role, but by God, Cage absolutely does his thing and it benefits this wacky, incredibly imaginative movie wonderfully.All of the characters here feel so real and human. Miles' strong sense of honor and commitment to the ideals of his role models make him such a likable and easy-to-root for lead. Long before Miles dons his iconic red & black hoodie costume from the comics, he fully embodies the selflessness, compassion and empathy that make Spider-Man such an inspirational and iconic character. I can totally understand why his kindness and capacity for good inspire Jake Johnson's Spider-Man to return to his heroic and altruistic ways he had long since abandoned. The film really does an excellent job of testing Miles' will power, the sincerity of his innate goodness, putting him through the ringer emotionally as he suffers insurmountable, but staggeringly human, losses. This is the kind of Spider-Man that I wanted to be when I grew up. The character journey that Peter Parker goes through here is easily the most nuanced and layered he's experienced in a movie. From the deadbeat loser we see in the first act, to the hopeless martyr of the second to our Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man we witness in the third, the sheer depth (And natural pace) of Spider-Man's development here is something I honestly never thought the screenwriting duo of Lord & Rothman were capable of. Even with villains and minor characters like Kingpin, Uncle Aaron and Miles' father Officer Davis are all characters whose hopes, dreams, fears and ambitions are all things I could easily describe.Much like Suicide Squad, the film makes the wise decision of using its vast and diverse gallery of characters to bring in a wondrous array of different visual styles. We have the urban graffiti style of Miles Morales, the 60s Marvel style of Peter Benjamin Parker, the Marvel Now! style of Spider-Gwen, the Golden Age comics style of Spider-Man: Noir, the Acme style of Spider-Ham and the anime style of Peni Parker. It's no secret that the film's core message is that anyone with a big spine and a bigger heart can be Spider-Man, but what makes Into the Spider-Verse so impressive is that, like the best comic books, it conveys this all visually. Every one of these different styles gets their own spot in the sunlight and I feel that every viewer will find a style here that really touches them on a personal level, just as each viewer is likely to find a Spider-Man here who they can relate too and resonate with emotionally. Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse isn't merely a great comic book movie, it's a comic book brought to life.I'll always have appreciation for soundtracks that really capture the musical tastes of a specific generation. They almost act as cultural time capsules of the time in which they were released. Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse very much fits this description, featuring some of the best and most atmospheric songs of Post Malone, Juice Wrld, Seezyn, XXTentacion, Swae Lee and Annuel AE's careers. I haven't loved a soundtrack to a comic book movie this much since Spawn. Just like that film, Into The Spider-Verse's soundtrack really captures the musical atmosphere of the late 2010s. It just set such an emotional tone for the film, one that's very much earned with this excellent and moving screenplay.Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse is easily the best superhero film of 2018 and its place as the 2nd best Marvel film to date is unlikely to be unseated by anything else. It's a must see for anyone with even a remote love for the character and it completely makes up for the terrible depictions of Spider-Man in both Captain America: Civil War and Spider-Man: Homecoming. It's nice to see my faith (Or, relative faith over Marvel studios, at least) rewarded.\n",

            "Review text: This film was phenomenal for so many reasons. First and most importantly, it was the most visually impressive film I have seen to this day. The animation style alone had such a mystical and wonderous quality to it. The animators didn't stop there, however. They added so many little fun details that made me feel like I was watching some sort of blend between comic and movie. In addition to the gorgeous visual nature of Spider-Man, I was impressed by both the humor and the meta references. The reference to the cringey Spider-Man 3 scene and the post-credits meme reference were my personal favorites. There were tons of little details that I am sure I never truly appreciated because I have never been a consumer of comic books, but I have to imagine that this film is even more special to Marvel comic fans. The only gripe that I have with Spider-Man is that it failed to keep my attention in act 3. It was longer than it should have been, and it would have benefited greatly by cutting down 10 minutes. With that being said, this is the best movie I have seen in a few months and I hope that my review reaches someone who was not going to see it and urges them to reconsider.\n",

            "Review text: 1) It's bad. I didn't like Jurassic World, but this is worse. It's got broad characters, lackluster set-pieces, a noisy score and the kind of script which should be punishable by throwing its writers to sharks. At least Jurassic World, mediocre as it was, had the good sense to copy the first Jurassic Park. Fallen Kingdom foolishly imitates The Lost World instead, with a semi-watchable first half on the island and an abysmal last act with dinosaurs wreaking havoc back to civilization.Kudos to the late John Hammond for building his park on a volcanic island. Also, I hate to ask but, since it's a plot point that dinosaurs will face extinction (again!) if they are not rescued from Isla Nublar... what happened to Isla Sorna (Jurassic Park 2 and 3)? There were dinosaurs on it as well. I'm sure some novelization or website makes up a lame excuse, but the movie doesn't.2) Stop overcomplicating blockbusters. Jurassic Park featured a smart sci-fi premise, but the actual plot had an elegant simplicity to it. Fallen Kingdom is the opposite, dumb but convoluted, tossing in betrayals, cloned little girls and evil corporations selling dinosaurs to warlords.3) Speaking of that, enough with the \"dinosaurs as military weapons\" nonsense! This is a concept which appealed to all of us when we were kids (\"I want to ride a T-Rex! With a rocket launcher mounted on its back!\"), but you cannot have War Dinosaurs in anything that wants to be taken seriously by adults.You know why Navy SEALs don't have trained lions? Why no army breeds rhinos to ride them into battle? Because nobody in modern warfare would spend millions for a huge beast which would be an economical and logistical nightmare to raise, train, feed and manage, especially when a random enemy soldier could blow it to smithereens with a 100 $ grenade. Someone should tell writer Colin Trevorrow that war elephants aren't a thing anymore, while firearms and explosives are.Note that the dinosaur boogey of this movie, the Indoraptor, is so ineffectual that it repeatedly fails to kill its unarmed preys in the endless climax. Some infallible weapon: there is a scene where three characters are pinned under a tree and the Indoraptor manages to... scratch one of them in the knee before they escape. You know what could have killed them more efficiently than your War Dinosaur? One guy with a pistol!By the way, the Indoraptor is trained to attack targets after you point a laser at them and emit an audio cue. Wait a second - if you are already pointing a gun with a laser beam at someone, can't you just PULL THE TRIGGER? It's a 30 cents bullet versus a 30 millions dinosaur. Bad guys, do your math.4) Fallen Kingdom assumes you are really, really interested in Blue, the Chris Pratt-trained Raptor from Jurassic World. This is understandable, since Owen's relationship with his Raptors was one of the few bits from the previous film which at least felt novel. However, the script retcons Blue into a sympathetic, heroic creature which displayed diligence and empathy since it was young; funny, I recall her killing several innocents in the previous movie and attacking Chris Pratt himself with no provocation in their first scene.5) Since we mention Pratt: much like Jurassic World, this movie doesn't know how to use him. Pratt is ideally cast not as a badass, but as someone who *thinks* is a badass - a character who is capable but still out of his league. He works so much better as a slightly comedic, self-deprecating protagonist than as a tediously infallible, dead-eyed action figure.His Owen never changes. There is more character development implied with a small prop in Jurassic Park (the Raptor claw Grant uses to scare a kid at the beginning and then throws away after bonding with Tim and Lex) than in all Owen's scenes in Fallen Kingdom.6) Howard is inoffensive but unremarkable as Claire: she is just kind of there, blandly good-looking, doing no damage but adding little value, like a lettuce in a sandwich. Her two sidekicks (Scared Nerd and Tough Latina) are insufferable though.(By the way, how is Claire not rotting in jail as the aftermath of Jurassic World? She is directly responsible for the dozens of casualties there, poorly handling the Indominus' escape and refusing to evacuate the island. She must have one hell of a lawyer.)7) Poor Rafe Spall, a competent actor (see The Ritual, a much better monster movie), plays Greedy Corporate Guy, an antagonist so flat and obvious that I was disappointed he didn't get an Evil Laugh Scene... you know, he throws his head back and bellows \"Bwahaha!\" while the camera cranes up.I love how Rafe Spall builds a containment facility for dinosaurs under James Cromwell's mansion. Cromwell plays Old Sick Naive Rich Guy. Sorry, I don't care how old, sick and naive you are: you have no excuses if you don't realize someone is HIDING DINOSAURS IN YOUR BASEMENT. Really, Trevorrow? Is this some kind of spoof?8) CGI is fine but overused. It's a visually busy movie.I'll give them credit for making the Indoraptor more visually distinctive than the Indominus. At least they sort of splashed some yellow on it.9) While Bayona's direction is competent (certainly better than this script deserved), I didn't care for most of the set-pieces. Remember how Spielberg took his sweet time with the T-Rex breakout or the Raptors in the kichen? Here most action beats are over right after they begin (the Baryonyx, the Carnotaurus...). There is no build-up, no crescendo. It's the cinematic equivalent of premature ejaculation.It's not just a matter of screentime though; the Dilophosaurus appeared in the first film for two minutes and is more memorable than any of the new creatures here. You have to do something creative and unique with your movie monsters. For example, the bunker attack could have been carried out by any carnivore; if you wanted a Baryonyx (which was possibly a semi-aquatic predator like the Spinosaurus), why not put it in the sinking gyrosphere scene?I did enjoy the prologue with the T-Rex and the Mosasaurus, although... why would the Jurassic World engineers build a giant door which allows the Mosasaurus to reach the ocean? What kind of scenario were they envisioning where the escape of the humongous sea monster would be a positive outcome?I mean, come on. I'm not usually a nitpicker, but this movie seems to be trolling anyone giving it a minimum amount of thought. A plot hole doesn't automatically ruin a story, but the cumulative effect of all this nonsense conveys a staggering lack of thought and care.10) The silly ending sets up another sequel. I guess we'll finally get the inevitable War Dinosaurs.*sigh*4/10To people asking \"What were you expecting in a film about dinosaurs?\", I answer: \"Something maybe not on par, but at least in the same league as Jurassic Park, one of my favorite movies of all time\".\n",

            "Review text: It's very much worth noting that I absolutely hated the original Jurassic World. Colin Treverrow's 2015 reboot suffered from undeveloped and uninteresting characters, a lack of emotional stakes, hideous CGI and, above all, a distinct lack of any style or atmosphere. So how is it, pray tell, that its sequel, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, is one of my favorite films of the year and my 2nd favorite film in the franchise, surpassing even the 1993 Steven Spielberg classic? (For my money, nothing beats Spielberg's terrible and beautiful cautionary tale of nature, The Lost World: Jurassic Park) Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is the rare modern franchise reboot with identity, sole and purpose, the rare reboot that genuinely succeeds with flying colors in re-capturing the lightning in a bottle that made the original great. It's not rehashing the original film and condescending the rest of your franchise legacy with awful meta humor like Halloween (2018), it's forging your own unique identity and breathing new life into the series. And Fallen Kingdom does that wonderfully.If you asked me to describe any of the characters in the original Jurassic World beyond their one-note personality quirks, I'd come up completely blank. If you were to ask me to describe the characters in Fallen Kingdom, however, I could go on forever. Claire Dearing is the Dr. Frankenstein of the film; passionate, proactive and blinded by her own ambitions, hubris and sense of righteousness. Her entire reputation, everything she's grown into since the events of Jurassic World, any chance she has at personal redemption for the lives lost on Isla Nublar 3 years ago, hinges on her saving the animals she once viewed as nothing more than corporate assets. She is driven by her emotions (Particularly her deep seated personal guilty), passions and code of ethics rather than merely plot convenience or cold, unconditional logic as was the case in the original Jurassic World. This makes her character far more relatable and human and her errors in decision making a lot more forgivable and understandable. Her arc from self-tortured and arrogant martyr to willing and humble hero is handled with a surprising degree of subtlety that not many critics have given her credit for. Owen Grady also benefits from a stronger characterization in Fallen Kingdom, we get to see more of his relationship with Blue and understand why and how he formed such a strong relationship with her. Fallen Kingdom does an excellent job establishing Owen as a man outside of and uncomfortable with the civilized world, exhausted with the pretensions and self righteousness of his fellow human beings. The honesty, trust and unconditional love he's shared with Blue since birth means the world to him and his love for her is the one thing he has left that's truly worth fighting for. Because the cast is playing actual characters this time around rather than merely hollow archetypes, the performances improve tenfold. Bryce Dallas Howard is allowed to be confident, fervent and passionate in her vocal delivery. Chris Pratt is allowed to be emotionally vulnerable and nuanced in his facial acting.Even the dinosaurs have more character here than they had in Jurassic World; Blue's mini-arc of feeling distrust and abandonment from Owen to repairing their broken relationship is certainly more character development than any terrible lizard of Jurassic Park movies prior and the Indoraptor has both an odd sense of tragedy and unique, slasher villain-esque aesthetic that give her a real sense of identity that the Indominus Rex lacked.Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom possesses possibly the most striking and memorable aesthetic of any Jurassic Park film to date. The tone feels deliciously Gothic horror inspired with some beautifully chilling and dark imagery that really captures the feeling of terror and majesty held in the Crichton books. In an age where so many Hollywood blockbusters are so unbearably dull in their visuals, Fallen Kingdom retaining the style of a Gothic monster movie is as refreshing as it is gorgeous to take in. Also, it's definitely worth mentioning than the effects have improved significantly from Jurassic World, in large part due to the combination of CGI and animatronics and the darker pallete.Finally, I wish to discuss the film's ending and the character of Maisie, both of which have been under heavy scrutiny and both of which I loved. Isabella Sermon is one of the most endearing, ranged and talented child actresses I've seen since Danielle Harris and she does a phenomenal job handling her character's slow and methodical unraveling or her traumatizing origins. Maisie also brings real weight to the film's ethical question and a legitimate argument for why humanity shouldn't let the dinosaurs die. Maisie's creation as a clone was by all means unethical. However, this does not mean that killing or abandoning her would be the responsible decision to such an ethical mistake. This is why Maisie has to be the one to set them free into the world; she understands the ethical mistake behind their creation, but also that the murky ethical circumstances behind them is not necessarily their fault. She has an empathy for these creatures that none of the other humans do. The dinosaurs in Fallen Kingdom having much more in the way of characterization and personality already established the foundation for this argument and Maisie makes that argument all the more difficult to answer.If you had told me a year ago that I would be praising a Jurassic World sequel as the 2nd best in the entire franchise, I would have called you crazy. But, lo and behold...Here we are. I love this film to the point where I could defend it for hours. I love the themes, I love the performances, I love the characters, I love the effects. I loved it. I loved it. I'll keep saying it if you want me too.\n",

But i was positively surprised by this newest release of the series.Whereas the first reboot just tried to copy the original movie with a theme park idea and brought not much new into the series and was very boring overall, the second reboot makes alot different. For once the setting is different and not again on a secluded island. It is also alot more exciting with more suspense than the first movie. Also I liked the ending...I would give it 8-9 out of 10.\n",

            "Review text: While the original 1993 film remains my favorite movie (not just of the franchise, but of ALL TIME), this film is a very close second. From the trailers, it seemed like the Indoraptor was pure evil, but after seeing the film itself, I realized that it had been abused, teased, and tormented that drove the animal mad.I don't truly believe it would have killed Maisie Lockwood had it actually caught her in the iconic moment seen from two of the trailers. When it reached out from its cage, notice that it simply brushed her hair. It could have nabbed her, pulled her into the cage, and eaten her if it truly wanted to.The real monster was Ken Wheatly. He was terribly cruel and when the Indoraptor bit his arm off, I was hoping it would bite his head off. Other antagonists included Eli Mills and that dinosaur-selling greedy b*****d (Gunner Eversoll) who wanted to make a fortune, despite Henry Wu's protests.There are at least THREE tear-jerking scenes in this film, not just one.(1) The one everyone knows - when the Brachiosaur is on the dock before it's engulfed by the lava and smoke.\n",
            "(2) When Zia operates on Blue and tries to remove the bullet in her leg while the poor animal struggles to stay alive - especially when Blue sheds a tear.\n",
            "(3) When the dinosaurs are trapped in that room as it fills up with toxic gas before Maisie releases them.Those are the scenes that made me emotional, though I doubt those are the only scenes in this movie that have that effect on me.Since the Indoraptor isn't as evil as I had thought from watching the trailers before I saw the film, I must say its death scene is a little bit sad for me. Granted, it's not as emotional as the scenes above, but it still has some drama to it.I can't decide if Henry Wu is an antagonist or not. In some scenes, he appears to be, but not in others. It's like, he is, but he isn't.As much as I love this film, it still could have been better. For one thing, the Indoraptor should have bitten Wheatley's head off, rather than his arm. For another, Blue should have gone with Owen and the others at the end. He asked her to come with him and told her that she would be taken to a safe place. Perhaps, that place could have been at Owen's cabin after he finished building it.How is Blue going to take care of herself this time without Owen? Will Blue die in \"Jurassic World III\" (whatever its title happens to be in 2021)? Suppose she encounters deer/bear hunters in the woods and they shoot her between this film and the third one. Now that she's in the United States, there's no telling what will happen to Blue without Owen. While she wanted freedom, I think Blue would have been better off going with Owen and the others.\n",

            "Review text: While it may not quite be in the same league os Spielberg's original, \"Jurassic World; Fallen Kingdom\" is certainly the best of the sequels. It's got a better than average plot, a funny script, excellent special effects and a good cast. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are back. Jeff Goldblum makes an appearance and Rafe Spall, Toby Jones and Ted Levine are excellent villains. The director is J.A. Bayona who has already proved his mettle with the likes of \"The Impossible\" and \"A Monster Calls\" and he certainly knows how to make a monster movie. In fact, as monster movies go this one has classic written all over it, (there's even a nod in the direction of \"King Kong\"), and, of course, yet another sequel seems almost certain. It may play to the gallery and perhaps it's a little too in awe of the first film in the franchise but you don't go to a movie called \"Jurassic World; Fallen Kingdom\" expecting high art or even too much originality. I loved it.\n",

            "Review text: Obviously I am in a small group of those that found this movie thoughtful. Yes, I love the standard Jurassic plot formula, of course, however this film looks at the animals more than being killing machines and it pares that perspective with one of the ugliest sides of mankind, the marketing and selling of animals with no consideration or empathy to the animals well being. One scene in movie as the ship was pulling away from the island leaving one Brontosaurus on the shoreline literally brought me to tears. Some people may find this hokey yet I feel that those involved in creating this installment of the Jurassic series were brave to make the movie they did.\n",

            "Review text: In every \"Jurassic\" movie there are 2 certainties. The T-Rex is always built up until at least the second half, and the T-Rex will show up at the very end, usually saving the main human characters in what I've dubbed \"Deus Rex Machina\". This \"Jurassic\" installment breaks the mold by having neither. (Good. These films were starting to get a bit predictable.) Parts of it still feel a bit too familiar, mostly because the first half of the film is essentially a remake of \"The Lost World\" Jurassic Park movie, and some of the \"twists\" are really, really stupid, even for this franchise. And yes, there are a lot of really dumb decisions made by the characters. The action sequences are edge-of-your seat, the danger and stakes have been upped significantly, and the second half turns this from action movie into horror movie, and it is intense! The CGI really needs to stop though. The first \"Jurassic Park\" looks better than this, and that came out in 1993. After watching \"Park\" and then this, the CGI really stands out in a bad way. They really need to go back to using practical effects. This is still a very fun movie, despite being more of the same, and I'd say it's at least worth a rent.\n",

            "Review text: This movie I neither as bad or as good as most people are saying. It's very fun and well made. The action and CGI are pretty fantastic, and there were some genuinely tense moments, which is one of the things that fallen kingdom did better than Jurassic World 2015. That movie had a lot of cool action but was lacking in stressful and suspenseful scenes which this movie makes up for. The characters are a bit more well rounded the JW 2015. Owen has about the same amount of likability (as in a lot) but Claire is actually likable in this one unlike JW 2015. And the new characters are alright. As for flaws, the movie's pacing can drag a bit, making the film boring in parts. And the actual plot is all over the place. It's said in the movie that when the island explodes, via volcano, that all the dinosaurs will be gone... WHAT ABOUT SITE B / ISLA SORNA!!! There are plenty of dinosaurs there, you could even move the dinosaurs there. Also human clones now exist in this universe, which doesn't break the continuity or the rules of this universe but it's still pretty stupid. Also the villain really sucks. Just a money hungry businessman. Some aspects are better and some aspects are worse than JW 2015, while the original is more consistently pretty good. It's not as good as Jurassic World. So besides a few fundamental plot holes, it's a pretty good movie, and the set up for the next one presented in this one has me really hyped for JW3/JP6. This movie gets 76%\n",

The acting was worse, the plot looked like a sieve, but its was a great rock-em-sock-em robot movie.Fallen Kingdom brings some great things to the JP franchise. Suspense is one of them. In the first JP, they had loads of it, the others between this one and the original do not. Where the \"sequels\" bring loads of action and explosions and running and screaming, this one has you chewing your nails. \"Are they going to drown?\" \"Dont look behind you!\" \"OMG its in her room!!\"There are serious plot holes too, like how a massive sea beast survives for 3 years in a tank with no food, or not getting sick for whatever reason? Or WHY would anyone save these dinosaurs, after everything that happened in the past parks and attempts, how is this a good plan? Why would Hammond build his billion dollar park on a possibly unpredictable volcano? What happened to the critters on Isla Sorna? What possible value would these beast have to the military? A well aimed missile strike from a jet would make short work of a rampaging T-Rex.But in the end, its a fun movie, plenty of action and Spielberg Suspense as well as a wee bit of the McGuffin.As the title says, you either hate it or love it.I for one dont hate it.\n",

            "Review text: Ant man and the Wasp is a successful sequel that contains comical moments like the first movie. The special effects and storytelling add elements of science into the MCU. We can see the film being more creative with the idea of \"Pym Particles\" where objects are being enlarged and downsized more frequently. One great thing about the film is the relationship between Hope and her mother, Janet. Like Christopher Nolan's Interstellar, this film explore the idea of love extending beyond space and time, and the writers did so with the details that were already established in the story. The relationship between the main two female characters can be described as a game of hide and seek, Hope's motivation in the film is simply finding her motivation her, like how she always lost the game in her childhood. But all movie came with imperfection. Once again, like the previous film, Hank Pym's character is poorly developed. The film villian Ghost, exist because of him being a jerk at the first place by not acknowledging her father's work. Yet the conflict between the characters resolved without Pym being forced to change. He was the same egotistic douche described in his youth at the end the of film. There were no apologies or struggles or choices touched to change his character. Generally, the film is entertaining to watch. It's my personal favorite Marvel in 2018. Since the film is dedicated to the main characters, the recently reunited family's death were made sadder than the ones in the Infinity War.\n",

            "Review text: So basically when I went and saw the first Antman movie 3 years ago which now feels like it was a year ago, I hated it. Similar to Guardians of the galaxy i just didn't find it funny. I felt that it was a bit to depressing in some areas though far less then the first guardians of the galaxy, and I just didn't find it that funny.And like guardians of the galaxy vol.2 I found this one as well a improvement over the first Ant-man movie, though it wasn't as big as an improvement compared to Guardians of the galaxy vol.2. For one for once i actually laughed watching this film unlike the first Ant-man movie. Such as the scenes where Ant-man does the card tricks to the FBI agent and then later in the movie we see him trying to learn the card trick that left me laughing. And so did a couple over jokes in the movie.As for the characters. Let me give you the short one on that:Ant-man: Basically threw out the movie he sucks not as being a character or being a superhero but because everything around him screws up.Wasp: I thought she was better in the first one. I hated her and she was once of the things I hated the most from the first movie. At least they got rid of that stupid haircut she had in the first movie. Hell even Luis points that out.Luis: He was hilarious he was my favorite thing from the first movie and thats saying a lot especially when you take into account my feelings for the first movie.Hank Pym: Hes a jerk throwout most of the movie, lad the movie brought of much of a jerk he can be at times.Ghost: Well Marvels been throwing out a bunch of new villains this year from Killmonger to Thanos and all of them are sympathetic. This one is sympathetic too, she has a really sad past. But just like Captain Marvel if she's been around for years being evil. Where the hell has she been all these years.And then theres the end credit scene the best part in the movie for me. Oh my god it was so shocking.In the end while this film isn't perfect, i do have to say that compared to the first movie this film is a big improvement over the first film. And for that i give this movie 7 out of 10. But because Hank is a jerk throwout most of it and Michelle Pfeiffer only gets around less then 10 minutes of screen time and you all know what happens to her at the end of the movie.\n",

            "Review text: I loved the first Ant Man and at that particular point I needed an Ant Man in the MCU. Same with the sequel. After IW, I wanted some fun. AM&TW takes place roughly two years after AM and A:CW and just before IW (come on, people, MCU has been building up to IW for 10 years, don't tell me you haven't been paying attention to the timeline even though the movies haven't been released chronologically!). I never thought anyone was any real danger, but I thought the pacing was excellent. The humor is wonderful, The Wasp is an inspiration to all Little Princesses. The \"villain\" was a character people could sympathize with (maybe they learned something from Killmonger in BP), and I even liked the throwaway comic villain as he provided the reason for some real action near the end. Was it an orchestral masterpiece? No. But it was everything *I* want from an afternoon at the movies. Quick, funny, jokes that are running from the first installment and a great \"OH NO THEY DIDN'T\" mid-credits scene to make you remember where you are. I loved it.\n",

Michael Douglas obviously didn't get the memo that he's supposed to be the straight, serious scientist because he cracks jokes the whole time. The romantic subplot between Antman and the Wasp was a bore. The presence of the villains seemed just a necessary cog to propel the action scenes/use cool CGI. It was a waste of good actors because Michael Douglas, Paul Rudd and Randall Park are all excellent usually. Park does have some good moments but honestly, you always see the punchline being set up from a mile off. I went to the bathroom halfway through just to have a break. There's nothing more cringy than a movie full of people all trying too hard to be funny.\n",

What's with the messy story line which turns out to be much ado about nothing (Quantum is the new Vibranium, Tesseract but lacks the intrigue), wasting the talents of Michelle Pfeiffer, Laurence Fishburne, having Randall Park play Detective Louis from Fresh off the Boat, the heavy handed parent-child messages, the one too many long, lingering looks (Scott and Hope, Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer), side jokes shoe honed into many scenes that get worn very fast and go nowhere and of course, the baddies...baddies who are such a joke that any conflict with them only serves to remind us that Ant Man is really a peewee in the Marvel Universe in every sense of the word. Wasp is a rare bright spark with Evangeline Lilly looking like she can wrestle Scarlett Johansson for the title of Marvel's hottest/kickass female superhero. You go girl!The theatre we were in was muted throughout the show and the first audible laugh was the baddies fessing up post truth serum, which was almost towards the end. Says a lot.Of course, you cannot not watch Ant Man & Wasp coz it is part of the MCU but if you're truly objective, you would know the MCU has a new contender for worst/most redundant/blah movie in its ranks.\n",

I was iffy about Avengeline L. in this one but she was perfect. The CGI effects were on point, as well as the crash scenes, driving scenes etc. It's very hard to get that effect of being small and making it look real but they did it.

At its core, it is about finding and re-connecting with the loves ones you haven't been with in a long, long time. It's sweet, and funny, and a toned down family film. The action scenes are pretty exiting, with things growing and shrinking, and other things disappearing and appearing.

            "Review text: I liked the first Ant Man film, it was a fun light on it's feet superhero film, Paul Rudd gave a funny likable performance, plays off of Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lilly perfectly, and Michael Pena stole some scenes.Follows the events after Captain America - Civil War, Scott Lang has under house arrest, but after a dream about Janet Pym will have him team up with Hank and Hope again, Hope is now the superhero known has The Wasp, Scott will have to don the Ant Man suit again.Every bit has fun as the first film, if you are tired of the intense drama of Infinity war, then this movie is for you. Rudd gives the same likable performance, Evangeline lilly really this time has The Wasp, and she and Rudd have great chemistry. Michael Douglas is also good, so was the scene stealer Michael Pena. The shrinking and growing effects are quite awesome.And the mid credits are a promo for the next marvel film/\n",

I am still not a fan of Black Panther however this one is worth more than Black Panther.This movie is funny and superb in the eye, got so many Wow! moments in it. Well made, fantastic work from Marvel. Rightfully deserved huge success,.. Thank you for the end Credit scene. It made my waiting for Avengers 4 so worthy. I would rate 8/10 for this movie but additional 2* is for Marvels Production. Thank you again.\n",

But I have always felt almost the exact opposite, I enjoy seeing a good actor but it mostly the story that got me into the theater. Lately, however, with some of the recent crop of stars, I seem to be enjoying their antics more than ever. So it was here, Paul Ruud has such a light touch, you wonder if he could really be as pleasant a guy as all that. I wouldn't be surprised.All that was needed was for him to be given a good script, some capable supporting actors, as here, and the movie would be a winner. This movie is no masterpiece but it's way above its competition in my opinion. You will be entertained from start to finish, in a tale that makes rough sense, despite its including some reflection about the ultra-small quantum world. The computer work is top notch and time flew for both me and my wife. Highly recommend.\n",

            "Review text: \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\" is just as entertaining and sensational as its silly, CGI-laden origins predecessor \"Ant-Man.\" For the record, \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\" picks up sometime after \"Captain America: Civil War\" (2016), so the sequel fits neatly into the Marvel Cinematic Universe timeline. The impressive thing about \"Bring It On\" director Peyton Reed's sequel is the chemistry as well as the charisma that the ensemble cast generates as events alternate between larger-than-life and smaller-than-life. At times, this amusing, lightweight, action-packed epic turns into a good-natured, slap-happy, screwball comedy. No, the world doesn't teeter on the brink of disaster. No, the most despicable supernatural dastard in the galaxy-Thanos-hasn't come to destroy Earth. Nothing so monstrous as that happens in this movie! This suspenseful, often hilarious saga confines itself largely to domestic issues. The FBI has Scott Lang, a.k.a. Ant-Man, (Paul Rudd of \"Wanderlust\") under house arrest for having violated of the Sokovia Accords during his illegal escapades in Vienna with Captain America against the Avengers. Meanwhile, Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas of \"Wall Street\") and his daughter Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly of \"Real Steel\"), still dodging the FBI, struggle to recover Hank's long, lost-in-limbo wife, Janet Van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer of \"Batman Returns\"), from the sub-atomic oblivion of the Quantum Realm. Ant-Man's Hispanic pal Luis (Michael Peña of \"Chips\") is still up to his ridiculous antics, spinning those long-winded tales, where everybody speaks with his voice in spite of visually being themselves! Indeed, virtually everybody from the first outing has returned for the follow-up. \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\" opens with stunning action set-piece that contains important backstory and foreshadows the outcome. We learn that the first Ant-Man was Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and his wife Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer) joined him on a mission to disarm a nuclear Soviet missile. They were forced to shrink themselves, going sub-atomic, to get between the molecules of the casing and defuse the missile. Unfortunately, Ant-Man's outfit malfunctions, so Wasp must save the day. Janet defused the missile, but she found herself trapped in the Quantum Realm for 30 years. In the original film, our hero learned about the Quantum Realm. An individual can enter The Quantum Realm, lying beyond the bounds of time and space, by wielding either Pym's Particles or a 'sling ring' like Dr. Strange. Anybody who saw \"Dr. Strange\" (2016) may remember the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) gave Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) a glimpse of this mysterious alternate dimension. As the action warms up, Dr. Pym and Hope are working diligently on a way to retrieve Janet using a tunnel of sorts to the Quantum Realm. Actually, their Quantum Realm tunnel reminded me of a smaller version on the vintage ABC-TV show \"The Time Tunnel.\" Furthermore, the characters ride in a chariot enclosed in a glass bubble that resembles a cross-between of a helicopter and a rocket sled. Reed and his quintet of scenarists: Chris Mackenna of \"Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle,\" Erik Sommers of \"Spider-Man: Homecoming,\" Andrew Barrer of \"Haunt,\" newcomer Gabriel Ferrari, and star Paul Rudd have refreshed matters with a two new nemeses. Affable FBI Agent Johnny Woo (Randal Park of \"Dinner for Schmucks\") constantly harasses Scott Lang after Scott has been sentenced to wear an ankle monitor. Meantime, Sonny Burch (Walton Coggins of \"The Hateful Eight\") complicates life for both Dr. Hank Pym and Hope. Initially, Lang has fashioned a thrill ride of sorts from several huge cardboard boxes to keep his daughter, Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson of \"Forever My Girl\"), amused while he is confined to his apartment. While they are playing, they crash accidentally through the fence surrounding Scott's apartment. Scott's ankle monitor goes off and alerts an army of Feds. The FBI storm in to search the premises. Naturally, they find nothing. Mind you, Scott has been warned not to associate with either Hank Pym or Hope Van Dyne. After the FBI leave, Scott contacts Hank on a burner phone about Janet. As it turns out, Hank has created a Quantum Tunnel with the help of unscrupulous go-between Sonny Burch, but Sonny wants to do the same thing Darren Cross did to Hank. Burch plans to sell Hank's technology on the black market. Our heroes tangle repeatedly with the FBI as well as Burch and his heavily armed henchmen. While they are contending with these conventional villains, they encounter the enigmatic Ghost a.k.a. Ava Starr (Hannah John-Kamen of \"Ready Player One\") who wants to appropriate Hank's sophisticated technology. This stealthy, supernatural, costume-clad foe is entirely new to the franchise. She can appear just as suddenly as she can disappear, but she has trouble controlling the duration of those appearances. Moreover, the sinister-looking Ghost isn't easily discouraged, and she surprises them every time she materializes out of the blue without warning.\"Ant-Man and the Wasp\" doesn't suffer from a shortage of outlandish action, relentless villains, and awesome set-pieces. Truly, Hank Pym has surpassed himself in this sequel. Not only has he managed to reduce the size of his city-block research laboratory building down to the size of a hatbox, but he also can roll it around like a suitcase on wheels with a handle! The whiplash changes in size for humans, buildings, and automobiles has multiplied beyond anything in the original. Hank has a Hot Wheels 30-Car Toy Storage Case with a variety of vehicles which he can change into full-sized vehicles. The careening chase with Burch and his henchmen smashing and crashing into Hank's van down a busy San Francisco street is exciting stuff. Ghost follows our heroes and gives them twice as much trouble. At one point, after he gets his hands-on Dr. Pym's hatbox-sized research lab, Burch tries to escape on a ferry. Suddenly, Ant-Man turns into a giant, plunges into the bay, wades out the ferry, and takes the lab away from him. Naturally, the FBI is in pursuit, too. \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\" is as hilarious as it is hair-raising.\n",

LOVE BOATLet me put it this way, This more of a love story than the kids can dissect from this movie. Sure its wacky and just plain fun, but really, its more of less a movie that could be described as the \"Toy Story 3\" of 2018.By that i mean, its got a good story line and the characters really show their colors in this movie. But, it kinda drags a bit with this one and the jokes were kinda uncanny. But, its still a watch for the family to see. Let me just point out something, watch the first two before this one!!!! 9/10\n",

            "Review text: This website seems to think the movies got worse as they went on, while RottenTomatoes thinks the opposite. I'm going with RottenTomatoes on this one. The advertisements made it look like it took place at the beach, when the beach barely appears at all. The basic plot is that Dracula and the monsters are going on a vacation on a cruise. This film probably only works so well because of Ericka. This has got to be one of the funniest characters I've seen in awhile.Her appearance seems to be based on Popeye. She just steals every scene she's in, especially with how she's constantly in motion, a trait rarely seen in female cartoon characters. It's admittedly a tad predictable, but still quite nice. It helps that the animation is so impressive. It seems like Adam Sandler is just pumping out movie after movie and this is one of his best. It really does feel like a feature length Looney Tunes or Tom and Jerry cartoon. ***\n",

            "Review text: Why do critics hate on the \"Hotel Transylvania\" series? Is it because Adam Sandler is in it? That might be it, though I honestly haven't gotten a clue. My reaction to the series is kind of interesting. I thought the first movie was decent but didn't really see rewatch value in it while I thought two was pretty good and actually found it did have rewatch value. Now we have the third movie in the series, \"Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation\", a film that I also really enjoyed. I don't think it was as good as the second movie, but I still found it a pretty fun watch.Count Dracula (Adam Sandler) has started to get pretty lonely and bored at being at his famed hotel for monsters. Wanting to see him happy as well as hoping to spend some more time with his family, his daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez), son in law Jonathan (Andy Samberg) and grandson Dennis (Asher Blinkoff) decide to go on a cruise ship for monsters that is en route to the lost city of Atlantis. While on board the ship Dracula immediately falls for the ships captain Ericka (Kathryn Hahn) unaware that she's the great great granddaughter of Professor Abraham Van Helsing (Jim Gaffigan) who is planning to destroy all monsters starting with Dracula. What follows next is seeing the monsters enjoy the cruise while dealing with the actions of the Van Helsing's.As you could tell from the plot, the film is more of series of jokes strung together to make a movie which is not a bad thing. Most of the jokes actually really work and did give me a good laugh. I particularly loved the creative scenarios they did with the locations. My favorite had to be the Bermuda Triangle. I won't give away what it looks like, but I'll just say it was very creative what they did with it. Also, the soundtrack was finally great! One of my biggest issues with the last two movies was how modern and dated the pop songs were and in this case, I think there was only time it did irritate me. Every other song was great. I don't even have to say that the animation is great once again. Director Genndy Tartakovsky once again delivers some fantastic fast paced animation and some eye popping colors. This film's creativity was so massive that it was clear that he and really turned around the creativity at Sony Picture Animation after the disastrous \"Emoji Movie\". The characters are mostly pretty good. It was fun to see most of the characters again, Wayne and Wanda had a pretty funny scene together, and also seeing Jonathan and Mavis was also charming. It was also nice seeing more of Dennis and Winnie bonding together. Seeing them work to keep their giant dog hidden was so funny. Even though most of the film was good, there were some problems. Van Helsing as a villain did not work at all. The last two films didn't have a villain to a story and worked well without one and in this film, adding one just slowed down the movie. Not only that, he was also not very funny. Also, I did kind of miss Jonathan's parents. They were pretty funny and I kind of think adding them to this film would've added some pretty funny humor. Though that was kind of a nit pick.\"Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation\" was still a pretty good sequel with a weak but still funny story, top notch animation and some mostly pretty good characters. Even though I do think the second movie was the best in the series, I still think this was a pretty good movie and I definitely have plans of watching it in the future.\n",

I mean, the ENTIRE cast doing the Macarena dance, very hard to watch. The character development on Dennis and Winnie was fantastic. I would like to see that in HT 4 if that's EVER gonna happen. Overall the story was fine, Character development needs some improvement, and needs more work on jokes. Over all just mediocre, not too bad, not too good.\n",

The writers did an awesome job by making it entertaining for kids and adults. While the first films elicited a slight chuckle here and there, there were several scenes in this where I was laughing out loud. Also, anyone who has ever been on a cruise can relate to many of the scenes which made it even more enjoyable.

            "Review text: I took my 7 year old to see this movie. We have watched the first 2 like 100 times each and she just can't get enough of it. When I saw they were making a 3rd one I promised her we would see it when it came out. I was afraid since this was the 3rd movie that it wouldn't be that good. I was wrong! My daughter and I both enjoyed this movie. It's a great family movie that will have both parents and children laughing. We really enjoyed it and I hope they continue to make more Hotel Transylvania movies.\n",

All the voice acting is impeccable (strangely, the only role I can stand Adam Sandler in), and although at times it can feel a little like a series of skits rather than a coherent whole, the fast-paced busyness of it all will definitely appeal to younger audiences. The women and girl characters kick butt, which is always awesome to see. Not sure why characters in this franchise are so impulsive when it comes to getting engaged? But the battle at the end is epic and definitely worth seeing at a cinema, or somewhere with some rad speakers! A much better film than you would assume the third in a franchise would be.\n",

            "Review text: I admit that I did not have high hopes for the third part of the franchise. I set the bar extremely low and entered the cinema with low expectations. However, the movie proved me wrong and exceeded my expectations. While no where near as good as the first movie, it truly gives every character time to shine. The scene where the family of Dracula and his friends took the plane (Gremlin Airways) was hilarious. Dennis and Jonathan were as usual the funniest characters in my opinion. There is a overload of characters in this movie and not every character grabbed the spotlight. The animation was incredible like the previous films. I loved Dracula and Erika's relationship and found it pleasing how they dealt with her great grandfather. The reveal that she was related to him was quite underwhelming and lackluster. To conclude, this movie definitely surprised me and did not disappoint. It had great humor, great interactions between characters and a surprisingly good storyline. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. It is pure fun.\n",

TRANSYLVANIA 3: SUMMER VACATION posits that the former clan can bury their hatchets (or oak stakes), while the latter blood-thirsty crew can simply switch to V-8 Juice consumption. Not everyone will buy this, just as the play \"Summer for Hitler\" (featuring that catchy lyric, \"Oh, the Nazis and the Semites should be FRIENDS!\") flopped at the box office, closing after just 11 not-sold-out performances. However, at a time when an Oval Office Occupant is taking his cues from \"Saturday Night Live\" by jumping into bed with \"Mad Vlad,\" the Russian Czar, perhaps TRANSYLVANIA's Glad Dad (aka, Count D) hitting the sheets with a Van Helsing is just another sign of these, The End Times. So don't be surprised if TRANSYLVANIA's Sony bosses borrow Bambi from Disney for a sequel in which Thumper's godson romances a hunter's daughter. Sure, the groom's granny won't be attending any of the wedding festivities (since Walt served her up as meat balls in the 1900s), but isn't an after-dinner belch somewhat of a happy ending?\n",

            "Review text: Okay, here's how the story goes: On July 14th (the day after it premiered by the way), I went to Landmark Cinemas (which is just a 10-minute drive from a mall where my brother is shopping at) to see Hotel Transylvania 3, and - sorry to be the elephant in the room but I need to say it - I don't like it. Yes, You heard me, I don't like it.So our movie starts off with a flashback of The Drac Pack (let's just call the group Dracula & the Boys 'cause it sounds more funny) fighting off arch-nemesis Van Helsing, then we randomly cut to a wedding (Wait, didn't we already have one in the 2nd movie?) and Dracula is in need of a girlfriend (a plot that should've worked better for the whole movie), and out of nowhere, Dracula & the Boys and the other monsters go on a cruise ship, Yeah, unfunny and pointless scenes aside, We have many forced subplots that had little-to-no point of the plot, one of which is about some confusing romance with Dracula and Ericka (the daughter of an immortal Robo-Van Helsing, not a spoiler though, It's confusingly revealed in a trailer), And then we end off with Dracula & the boys defeating the Kraken with... The Macarena of all things, Yeah... Let that soak in your mind for a little bit. (oh yeah there's a marriage with Dracula and Ericka too while you're at it)You know, I actually liked the first two movies, but this is just a boring movie to watch, Sure, I wasn't expecting a movie like The Lion King but I am not a big fan of movies that has little-to-no plot, Wait, crazy? Who, me? What kind of person would even be crazy during a movie that has A FINAL BATTLE WITH THE MACARENA PLAYING OVER IT!?!? I'M FINE, THOMAS, I'M FINE!!! It's not only one of those movies that doesn't entertain me, But it's the laziest movie I've ever watched! (Even \"Who Killed Captain Alex?\" has a good kind of lazy that \"Hotel Transylvania 3\" doesn't have.) And I ACTUALLY saw this before seeing Ant-Man and the Wasp! (I recommend watching it, Also, did you know that the ending took place during Avengers: Infinity War?) Well I mean, if Thanos can snap his fingers during Ant-Man and the Wasp, Why not use the snap on animated movies like the godawful Hotel Transylvania 3? (\"Grandpa Vlad, I don't feel so good...\")Overall, I give this movie a 3/10, Save your money for something more enjoyable for your children like Incredibles 2 or - surprisingly - The Teen Titans Go! Movie or more alternatively when it comes out on Redbox. (Please don't make me disappointed, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse...)Well, hey, At least the granola cookies I ate can improve my experience a little.\n",

            "Review text: I really loved the first two Hotel Transylvania movies, but this one was TERRIBLE. We had to wait three more years for this DRECK?I couldn't believe it could be so bad after the first two movies-which were very good. (The trailers for HT3 are way better than the actual movie.) Of course, per the title, the location was completely different (I think they would have done better just to have developed another plot line within Hotel Transylvania once more) and many of the main characters from the other HT movies barely got any lines. I thought one of the really good things about Hotel Transylvania 2 was that they really developed the personalities of Drac's friends like Frankenstein, the Mummy, etc. Totally missing here.Script seemed lame without a lot of clever dialogue like particularly in Hotel Transylvania 2. Even Mavis, Johnny and Dennis seemed to be largely missing for large portions of the movie.I don't know if even the stars of the Hotel Transyvania \"franchise\" were getting tired of it. It seemed like even Adam Sandler, Selena Gomez, Kevin James, etc. really just kind of mailed it in.Script seemed to be all over the place. Quickly tried to explain the background of the feud between Drac and his archenemy from way back, then suddenly they decide to go on a \"surprise\" cruise without really explaining why they were going in the first place. Script seemed very disorganized and incoherent. Unfortunately, I left very disappointed. Seemed to be the classic case of just patching together a lame sequel to shamelessly try to make a bunch of money off the previous two successful movies.While I wholeheartedly recommend the first two Hotel Transylvania movies, this one I DON'T recommend-unless you can find a lawyer to sue Sony to get the wasted 90 minutes of your life back.\n",

            "Review text: This movie being the unnecessary sequel to a movie that was trash level is in fact just about as bad as you would expect. This sequel does however resemble its predecessor very closely in the way that like Gnomeo and Juliet this movie too does quite a good job at the story it is trying to tell. If this movie was written as just a regular animated Sherlock Holmes film it would be pretty good. Sadly it is Sherlock GNOMES meaning it is filled with more cringy humor and trash throughout. Still much better that the original however.\n",

            "Review title: Surprisingly creative and entertaining!\n",
            "Review text: I was hesitant about seeing \"Sherlock Gnomes\", as its simple wordplay title makes it easy to dismiss. I tell you honestly, I thoroughly enjoyed it, and frankly at the end I was surprised by how much I had enjoyed it. It is far funnier, and far more creative, than its throw-away pun of a title would suggest.True, the story, which takes often broad comedic swipes at a well-established literary franchise, dares to ask its audience to accept the dual conceits that not only do we humans share our world with clay/ceramic garden gnomes which are actually living sentient creatures, but also that one of them is a hyper-intelligent investigator with a strong sense of duty. But once the story gets going (lead into by a Looney Tunes-esque news report), it does prove to have a surprisingly complex plot, in which there is in fact is a mystery in need of solving.Performances of minor and supporting characters range from acceptable to very good. The leads are very well done. Depp's Sherlock is arrogant and socially awkward yet comically unaware of this; he's also dry almost to the point of being the \"straight man\". Ejiofor readily elicits sympathy for his exasperated and put-upon Watson. McAvoy's Gnomeo and Blunt's Juliet are played with a good range of emotions, although in my opinion McAvoy goes further, for comedy/action effect.With so many full-CGI movies today, especially those ostensibly meant for children, it's easy for the viewer to get jaded and miss the details. This is unfortunate, because often the filmmakers put great detail into their films which enrich the viewing, even if those details are only seen subconsciously. \"Sherlock Gnomes\" is just such a movie, with often stunningly-rendered CGI. In an \"over the shoulder\" shot of Sherlock talking with Juliet, the side of his pointy, aquiline nose can be seen; it shows flecks and minor chips like an actual ceramic figure would have. This gives more visual weight to the scene than it would've had if that surface were rendered simply as a smooth plane. In another scene, we see that the apron strings tied around Juliet's back are not three-dimensional moving objects; they are in fact rendered to look hand-painted on, as they would be on an actual garden figure. A city scene of people walking past shops is so well-rendered, for a moment I actually thought I was seeing footage rather than animation. Along with the quality of the CGI, this film also has highly creative visuals. Sherlock's \"mind palace\" sequences are beautifully rendered as line-art animations.It is this rich detail which makes the film's one down point stand out so poorly. While the movie's soundtrack features much music by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, this is not a musical. For me, the inclusion of what was in essence a music video in the middle of the story was very jarring. The song is performed by a doll voiced by Mary J. Blige. Her character is well-rendered, and her dialogue is nicely delivered; however her singing style combined with the over-produced music made the lyrics almost entirely unintelligible. I found myself wandering off, which was regrettable because I realized I had been missing more great visuals. In the background are very impressive \"dance troupe\" animations which clearly have Ziegfeld/Berkeley/Esther Williams-esque choreography. These are easy to miss but definitely deserve to be noticed.Some weak gags in the trailer are not used in the film, to the film's improvement; one that does remain leads to a \"Hound of the Baskervilles\" reference which works well.Finally, the film's well-placed tribute to Ray Harryhausen is to be greatly appreciated.Overall, \"Sherlock Gnomes\" is a surprisingly well-executed and enjoyable comedy. Only that misplaced song keeps me from scoring it higher. This is a great movie for kids, and a creative treat for adults, especially parents. 9 out of 10.\n",

            "Review text: Sherlock Gnomes and Watson are the protectors of London's gnomes against the evil Moriarty. After defeating Moriarty, Sherlock is listless until he gets a new case of missing gnomes. Gnomeo and Juliet discover their family and friends have disappeared. They join Sherlock and Watson on their investigation.This franchise doesn't have the highest of ambitions. It does have some fun characters. This sequel adds an interesting Sherlock and Watson duo. I like them and I like their opening battle with Moriarty. The start is muddled by the fact that the franchise protagonists are Gnomeo and Juliet. There is a split in attention. Once the foursome is formed, they are actually fun together. The best part is Juliet being smarter and more capable than the arrogant Sherlock. Once the group splits up again, the fun chemistry gets muddled again. Mostly, I like these characters and the overly complicated scheme does fit the plot. It's a fun short time and this movie is short.\n",

            "Review text: Average, very average movie with locked potential. Seriously? After seven years we can see second part of Gnomeo & Juliet, cartoon from the far-far 2011. And first part wasn't so popular and interesting. Yes, allusion (or parody) on Romeo and Juliet was able to chained interest. Before you starting to watch movie. If not the name, I could not remember what is all about. And now new movie from the series. And if creators was planning to \"shake\" our imagination by \"original\" title \"Sherlock Gnomes\" and by some mystery - this attempt was unsuccessful.In our time of SpaceX and 3D printers, create an interesting cartoon is very... difficult. All this 3d and boom-boom with effects can't do your movie historical. More beauty, pleasant - maybe. Sherlock Gnomes is a display of the recent wave of interest to the old book hero. And creators didn't get on this wave. All cartoon is average. Really, there average action, average plot, average characters. Average interest to the movie. With Sherlock you expect on some mystery or interesting thoughts (from Sherlock, of course). But what we have is movie with \"There can't be any puzzle, our audience not be able to bear it!\".When you understand, that there are plot twist (!) with doctor Watson (!!) that became a main villain (!!!), the movie suddenly stop and said \"I'm a good film!\". And after one minute, when you got shocked about unexpected story, all returns to the main villain - Moriarty. Why!? This can be a good ending!?Besides, Moriarty. Well, what a toy he is? Really, he is baby doll? Or what? Yes, I'm afraid such dolls, but this is more caricature. And all Sherlock's line is looks like failed caricature on original story. So, you can spend an evening with this cartoon. It isn't so bad. But why, if there are so many other interesting movies. 4/10\n",

            "Review text: When an animated movie gets a sequel, I can typically understand why they usually get them. Sometimes they are made because the creators have brilliant new ideas to bring to the table while other times they are made because the first movie was a big hit at the box office and the creators see lots of money in their eyes and feel they can make more with a sequel. In most cases it's typically the latter, but in the case of \"Sherlock Gnomes\" it's neither. In fact, I absolutely have no idea why this movie exists. \"Gnomeo and Juliet\" wasn't a big critical hit nor was it a big box office hit, so why did the heads of Paramount Animation think that giving a mostly forgotten film from eight years ago a sequel would be a smart idea? I really don't know. What I do know though is that this film is bad. Really bad.A little while after the first film, the bickering neighbors Montague and Capulet settle their differences and move together to London where they set up their garden gnomes in a new garden. The leaders of the gnomes, Gnomeo (James McAvoy) and Juliet (Emily Blunt) are trying to make their garden more comfortable and beautiful for their friends and family. However, disaster strikes when all the gnomes in the garden are kidnapped by a pie mascot doll named Moriarty (Jamie Demetriou) and it's up to them Sherlock Gnomes (Johnny Depp) and his assistant Dr. Watson (Chiwetel Ejiofor) to find them. That's all there is to it with this plot. It's absolutely nothing new.The story is incredibly boring and dull due to how predictable it is. It goes through every twist and turn imaginable and even led to one of the dumbest plot twists that I've seen in an animated movie in a while. None of the jokes work as well. Although most of the bottom of the barrel jokes seen in the trailer were thankfully not seen in this movie, it's still incredibly unfunny with most being jokes about the characters being garden gnomes. It even opens up with three gnomes arguing over what story to tell using garden gnome puns like \"Game of Gnomes\" and \"Spider-Man: Gnomecoming\". I'm not making this up. The animation is totally wasted on this movie. The films computer animation incredibly dull and lifeless and barely has any shiny features to it yet the very few hand drawn portions are incredibly well done though it did make me mad that it went into this movie. Why of all movies coming out nowadays was a hand drawn animated scene put into \"Sherlock Gnomes\"? I mean, seriously! However, the film could have been saved if the characters were interesting and likable, but they're not. Gnomeo and Juliet are dry and tiresome, Sherlock Gnomes is incredibly annoying as is Moriarty. I guess Dr. Watson has a little likability in him, but not much.\"Sherlock Gnomes\" is incredibly pointless and pretty boring for an animated movie sequel. It's story is predictable and lousy, it's animation is totally wasted and the characters are all dry and tiresome. I really don't know why this movie was made and I really don't suggest you should watch this movie. Besides, most of the cast of this movie (some of which are Oscar winners or nominees) have been in better animated movies, the director of this movie also made \"Kung Fu Panda\", and there's a much better animated parody of Sherlock Holmes known as \"The Great Mouse Detective\" which was made by Walt Disney Animation Studios and those are much better animated movies to watch than this mess. Check them out instead. It's rather elementary, my dear readers.\n",

            "Review text: Sherlock Gnomes is a sequel to the film Gnomeo and Juliet which was released back in 2011. The first film was just ok, however the sequel sucks. The first problem with this film is just boring it is. I probably haven't felt this emotionless when watching a film in a long time. The other reason why this is a bad movie is how the film wanted you to think Moriaty is dead at the beginning but I knew he really wasn't so the end wasn't really a surprise when he did return. \n",

By the way, the villain is just a miserable try to make a version of the joker in The Lego Batman Movie.The most infuriating thing is that the movie tries to make you feel it's smart; showing 2D animated scenes to display the way Sherlock Gnomes thinks or how he tries to solve the mystery and all that absolutely nonsensical. Also, there is a plot twist that is presumed to be surprising.there are man many other problem but let's get over them and mention the very few things that I liked in this movie:The animation quality is surprisingly quite good.James McAvoy's and Johnny Depp's voice acting are the only two that are kinda good but the other actors aren't good (Emily Blunt's voice acting is very idle)The first 20 minutes are fast paced so I think this is a bonus! (The pace dragged every once in awhile due to \"dramatic\" moments or just to play some songs)I'm so disappointed that this movie came from John Stevenson, the same director who brought us Kung Fu Panda.

It was packed full of laughs from start to finish with humour for both adults and children. I watched it with two young children, 10 and 5, who enjoyed every minute. I would struggle to find fault in this film. It was well written with a fantastic storyline, giving non stop laughs and left you wanting to see more.

While watching, when Sherlock appeared for the first time, I felt like the scene came out of nowhere and no connection to the previous scene. I don't like that scene that much. The actors and actresses are basically good, but the song is very bad. I totally hate it! The animation is quite acceptable. All in all, the film might be your favourite, but I'm not a fan of it.\n",

I don't know how many gnomes that is but even if one in every one-hundred people have gnomes we're talking about over 70,000 gnomes. That's a lot of gnomes for one gnome to protect.When some gnomes go missing suddenly he has to kick it into gear and follow the clues.The overriding message of the movie is appreciating your friends and family above work. It's a comforting message no doubt, but the movie itself seemed a bit hollow. It was a satisfactory movie, but underwhelming compared to other kids' animations.\n",

            "Review text: Heartwarming story, but seems tailored to be more enjoyable to the 8-12 year old's as an upgrade from the 80's animated series. It's not your expected typical adult action filled Transformers installment. You can tell this was written by an inexperienced amateur writer, Christina Hodson. The directing was fairly decent, considering this was Animator Travis Knight's first live action film he's directed. Not sure why the producers (especially Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg) decided to cheap out on these key elements, and then have to pay for pretty much every fake 10/10 review this film has on here. The film's soundtrack was a good throwback to some good 80's songs. Hailee Steinfeld was perfect as always, but pairing her up with Jorge Lendeborg Jr. and his banana seat bike, made them both look like they were 12 years old. Although still enjoyable, I expected more. Would I recommend it? Yes for kids, not really for adults. Would I see it again? Nope, but I'm sure my 8 year old nephew will. It's a 7/10 from me.\n",

I bought the DVD before coming back home last week, with the idea that it would be a good family movie, and I was far from being wrong. This is not only a great film to watch with the kids, but also the best episode in the saga. 'Bumblebee' takes us back to the year 1987, and it looks and smells like if it was made in the 1980s with a great cast and an awesome soundtrack. I am listening to it while I am writing this review and I am already looking forward to watching 'Bumblebee 2' in theaters in 2022.\n",

            "Review text: The Transformers Movies, lets be honest aren't movies that offer soul. Despite making over billions with the Michael Bay films, Transformers are often noted to be mindless, soulless blockbusters. But with a new Director calling the shots and the focus being on just one of the Transforming Heroes, 'Bumblebee' is a pleasant surprise, that is indeed a Transformers Movie with Heart!'Bumblebee' Synopsis: On the run in the year of 1987, Bumblebee finds refuge in a junkyard in a small Californian beach town. Charlie (Hailee Steinfeld), on the cusp of turning 18 and trying to find her place in the world, discovers Bumblebee, battle-scarred and broken.'Bumblebee' works because the film focuses more on emotion than on action. Sure, there is action here and there as it has to be, it's a Transformers movie after all, but what is served here, intelligently, is a story offering soul. The relationship of Bumblebee and Charlie, is the film's heart. I liked the way their relationship is built up and how the emotional connect works. It comes across as genuine, rather than manipulative. And that's where 'Bumblebee' scores, it's more about love and bond, rather than just mindless action.Of course, there are flaws. The biggest one being that this is a familiar story and the beats are predictable. And the entire E.T. vibe is hard ignore. But again these are manageable flaws, in an otherwise charming film.Christina Hodson's Screenplay is well-done. And it seems the Writer has been influenced hugely by the prolific John Hughes, since her story has flashes of the late/great genius's craft. Travis Knight's Direction is perfect. Cinematography, Editing, Art and Costume Design, are quite good. Graphics, as expected, are excellent.Performance-Wise: Hailee Steinfeld shines as Charlie. She plays the protagonist and her performance is completely likable. John Cena, in a role with grey shades, clearly has a ball. Jorge Lendeborg Jr. is cute. Pamela Adlon is superb as Charlie's mother. Of the vocal performances, Dylan O'Brien as the voice of B-127 / Bumblebee, Peter Cullen as the voice of Optimus Prime, Angela Bassett as the voice of Shatter and Justin Theroux as the voice of Dropkick, are pretty solid.On the whole, 'Bumblebee' is a charming film that brings back the Transformers franchise into the game.\n",

            "Review text: I was a Transformers and Beast Wars fan from the 90's, I enjoyed the first two movies from Michael Bay, then the rest was horrible.The first 5 minutes of Bumblebee were good, then its goes to sh**. 90% of the movie focuses on the teenager's life and lame complications and fears. We barely see some action from Bumblebee, he is mostly being all cuddly and acting like a puppy. Instead of focusing on the origins of the Transformers and Orion Pax, we are hear watching the girl being bullied for not taking the dive... then conveniently having to take the dive in the end of the movie to... I don't know how she helps bumblebee underwater.That scene on the road where she aske her friend to take off his shirt to just wrap it around her head and scream out of the car...when she is clearly wearing a shirt over a t-shirt... stupid..That Salute sign from Cena at the end..I felt like i was watching a combination of Mighty Joe Young and Herbie Reloaded.

There are many scenes where the viewer is left confused wondering or hanging. Some scenes are simply repetitive and I feel not cut smoothly to be cohesive. Bumblebee dies/gets killed and gets resurrected approx 10 times which gets old after a while. John Cena should just stop playing any serious roles. He is funny until he tries to be serious or bring emotions on the screen. Just does not suit him. Hailee delivers a solid performance and definitley is the perfect fit for the role. The Soundtrack is just awesome with the best of the 80ies. Not a \"gotta watch it again\" movie. The emotional component of the \"missing father figure\" and the \"moving on\" aspect is done nicely and gives the film some depth.\n",

            "Review text: This movie was terrible. The pacing was slow, there was no story to fill in the time, just a bunch of driving around. The family scenes were forced and I felt no connection at all to any of the characters. The love interest was incredibly lame. John Cena's character was one of a typical dumb soldier, I much prefer all of the military characters from the first movie to him. At least they were funny. Not senseless shells of dumb.Bumblebee was cute, like a kitten, not the badass Transformer he's been in the past movies. The action scenes were typical and boring. Honestly the best part of the movie was the first 10 minutes. After that it was not fun, funny or even interesting. I almost left the theater and I am a huge Transformers fan. On top of that this film makes no sense in the world of the previous Transformer movies. Optimus Prime and the others didn't come to Earth until the first Michael Bay movie and in that movie they had no form yet. There are so many plot holes which makes the story even less interesting. This is almost a direct copy of Sam's story. Losers life that sucks then he/she gets a cool car and their life changes forever. Blah blah snore.I don't understand why everyone is saying this is the best Transformer movie ever. The first one was the best by far. People are looking for a Transformers movie that properly pays homage to the 80's Transformers we love, this movie is definitely not it. Don't waste your time or money.\n",

I had been a real fanatic of the Transformers in my childhood and I did not feel the movie treated the story nor the characters (nor the fans!) with respect. The sequels were worse every time, and they even blamed poor stories due to the Hollywood writers association going on strike (I'm not kidding, they really blamed it on that).\n",
            "This movie (Thank God at last !!!!!) undoes the harm done by the previous movies. It brought me back some good memories from my childhood fantasies. For once, the robots actually look like the cartoons. This is a big thing. The robots from the previous movies were horrible, and did not look whatsoever to the original toys.Producers for the next movies, please remember: The Transformers is a robot's story where human beings play a very secondary role in the same. It is not a story about humans in which robots are involved. Please don't ever cast goofy characters such as Agent Simmons (played by otherwise good actor John Turturro). It really kills the story. PLEASE READ THE COMICS AND WATCH THE ORIGINAL TRANSFORMERS CARTOONS before considering making more movies of these. If you don't get it, let other people produce them. Sure there are lots of them around.\n",

            "Review text: Let's be honest every Transformers movie other than the first one has been bad. The 3rd one had a great third act in Chicago but that's about it. I went into this with extremely low expectations and was really surprised. I can finally say we second good Transformers movie with this standalone Bumblebee movie. This is a movie with a lot of heart and that's not just due to Bumblebee but also with the human characters. They finally got a great lead with Hailee Steinfeld who gives a damn solid performance in this. The entire cast was good no one seemed like they were phoning it in for a paycheck. The action in this movie is a major step up from the sequels, you can actually tell what's going on and the visuals are beautiful and detailed. I was ecstatic to see they went back with the first generation designs. The Transformers are characters and you feel for them. If you're a Transformers fan you have to go see this movie.\n",

            "Review text: Bumblebee is possibly one of the most predictable, formulaic movies I have ever seen. Every cliché you could possibly imagine was unironically showcased in this movie. A protagonist with a dead parent? Check. A mean girl posse? Check. A countdown to the imminent destruction of the entire world? Check.I guess it's lack of creativity wasn't enough because they had to make sure the storyline was bad as well. For some reason, they decided that it would be a good idea to make Bumblebee mute at the very beginning of the movie, so he couldn't talk the entire time (save a few \"lines\" played through his radio). This resulted in Bumblebee being portrayed as Hailee Steinfeld's gentle pet instead of the fiercer character that was portrayed in the other Transformers\n",
            "movies. This film really could have been a remake of The Iron Giant. The similarities are uncanny.They really should have titled the film \"Charlie\" because it is more about her backstory than Bumblebee's. We receive a full character arc for her. We see her transform (haha) from an angry, troubled teen who isn't over her father's death and is too afraid to connect with people to a joyful, courageous girl who is able to connect with people again. We don't get anywhere near the amount of development for Bumblebee's character. The only new thing revealed about him is how he got his name, which happens in a 10 second clip. Poor Bumblebee played second fiddle in his own movie!Overall, the acting is good but the cliched storyline and the strayed focus of the movie ultimately caused its downfall. I guess Hailee Steinfeld and friends could save the world but couldn't save this film from being a disaster.\n",

            "Review text: Having watched the previous 5 films & be disappointed by the last 3 due to them being too long, too confusing & simply boring I was a bit skeptical with this one.But after watching, I have to say I was impressed! The film was actually pretty good far better than the transformers films previous (last 3).The film was more grounded for one, the story-line was simple & consistent as with the scenes which didn't drag or play out too long.The action & scenes involving Bumblebee & Charlie were spread well & you actually could follow this film a lot more than the previous films which were badly filmed, badly plotted, badly edited, badly directed... I could go on, but yes, this film had heart & had a simple story you could follow!You basically knew what was what & there wasn't too many jumps from scenes with millions of details thrown into your face!I even found this film to be more light hearted & more engaging with the characters being more developed, you actually felt for them! Not to mention the film wasn't a confusing a mess with multiple story-lines thrown in & getting tangled into one another! It was simple!A last thing to note, is that the film was under 2 hours in length! I misread the run time & thought it was longer, but found this film to be pretty short in comparison to the previous film which well over 2 hours unnecessarily! Hell, even the end climax was done & dusted fairly quickly & not dragged out for longer than needed! The film was 1 hour & 49 minutes long! This is how films should be! Not too long, not dragged out & kept to an appropriate length!I'm not much of a fan of the Transformers films, but this one was pretty decent! I actually liked this one! I overheard some people saying they hated this film! Don't get what their problems were because this film was actually good in comparison to the others which were way too long & boring! This film was consistent from start to finish!8/10\n",

Storyline is solid, although I'd say conservative. Acting was really well done, and the interaction with the 2 main characters is so heartwarming, you'd forget one of them is actually a robot. Bumblebee is not just a nice story about friendship, but about acceptance and pushing through adversity of any type. The accurate details in which this film brought back the characters and the story from the original comic series is overwhelming - I felt myself wanting to stand and cheer. This is the film they should have started with, and built from here. Will definitely add this to my treasured collection when it is digitally available. Kudos to the entire team who brought us this soon-to-be classic.\n",

            "Review text: When in the hell is the studio going to realize this! The worst part about all these movies is tolerating the humans and waiting for Transformer stuff to happen. I don't care about the girl who can't dive anymore because her dad died. Or the guy who's trying to get with the girl.I was really excited to see a non Michael Bay transformers. Just to see what else could be done. Turns out this has the same problems. Bay just goes for it in a huge way. So you get some really bad stuff and some really good stuff. In his movies I could tolerate the bad for the good.But the problem with this movie is that it tries much harder to be a good movie. They focus more on the emotional character story stuff. But it's not directed well enough to pull it off and the writing is terrible. The humor is stupid as well. At least Bay goes into it making a 13 year old boy movie, which he is successful at so while the humor is dumb the action makes up for it.The 80s references made me roll my eyes so many times. What is up with this 80s nostalgic porn that has plagued our movies? If we keep looking back and not forward we aren't going to have our own culture. And nostalgia in 30 years will be indistinguishable from the 80s. When Bumblebee sneaks into the house I thought, \"Here's the ET scene.\" And then after the girl comes home there's an open book and guess what page it's opened to? The poster of ET.References are fine but this was done not historically to create a world but for us to point out and say, \"Hey look it's Alf! I remember Alf! This movie is great they're referencing things I grew up with.\" The best references are to things that aren't classic today. Not everything that people were into then is classic now. And why wasn't there a Knight Rider reference? Was that too on the nose for this movie?The opening scene was killer and I wished we had more. Prequels like this are such a waste of time. Why do they expect us to be worried that things aren't going to work out? When we know exactly where it's going to end up? At least with Star Wars it was a legitimate backstory made to be watched first.John Cena was terrible. I got the sense that in every single scene he was thinking, \"I'm acting. This is me acting. This is what acting looks like. Don't look in the camera. Don't look in the camera.\"And why are movies making fun of themselves lately? Like at the end when he goes to grab her hand and they make this big joke it of it like it's Naked Gun? That's basically breaking the 4th wall and it's been happening a lot. I blame Guardians of the Galaxy for this. I think meta is the word? Everything is self aware and doesn't even take itself seriously, so why should we?We are really in a creative drought of movies and need something new to take us forward. Not back or in the stay in place like we've been.\n",

What is this. They got the transformer aspect right but failed hard with human plot and characters. John Cena is acting the best poor mans Channing Tatum. It's like a parody movie of the transformers story.\n",

            "Review text: The first 3 minutes of this movie were amazing, I was so pumped to watch the rest, but then after 10 minutes you realize, oh great bumblebee can't talk again. Then after 20 your like, they just cut Cliffjumper in half, wtf??? Then the movie continues on and your like, where is everyone??? Can't they find earth, what is taking them so long??? Teletran 1 must have broken down or something. Anyways, this turned out to be more of the same bay-formers, with less action and only 3 robots. Well, the original 1986 movie is still the best. Maybe they will make a prequel to this one and actually do it right. I should give this movie 3 stars, but they know what the fans want, and they continue to push out this junk, so your only getting one star. They think they are doing us a favor by playing 15 seconds of \"You got the touch\", but what they don't understand is that song only works if optimus prime is doing a twist flip in the air while blasting Decpticons.Fun fact:Did you know if you tie a transformer up with a chain and pull on it the right way, it will cause him/her to explode into pieces?\n",

            "Review text: Let's face it: We are TIRED of the unsuccessful attempts watching our beloved franchise of shape shifting robotic aliens dive deeper into the dirt of now being the most forgettable and tasteless of films of all times. Yet, they still take our money and give us trash. FORTUNATELY, Bumblebee isn't that film that suffers for overstuffed, overcooked and underperformed warzone fight scenes, clunky plot holes, or bad acting. Bumblebee stole my heart as it nods itself to the first Transformer's film in many ways that one, but with a bit more story and character development that started the billion dollar movie franchise. I deeply enjoyed how the movie was set in the mid to late 80s, which even me, as a 90s baby believe was the best era of both movies, music, AND fashion. This movie is just the right start of a new trilogy or series of films that lead into the very first live action film. Everything about it is JUST right. Don't expect too much though. We're not talking about prophecies or some weird past that forces the main protagonist to travel across the entire world to find answers, NO, Bumblebee has one mission and one mission only. And in this film, there's nothing better than a straight forward storyline that doesn't confuse us at the end of the film.\n",

It's not interesting, it's only funny in certain places and even then it only resulted in a small smile. If what's advertised to me as a comedy movie isn't that funny to me, I think it's failed as a movie. This could've had the potential to be a pretty decent movie and it's not the first time Illumination has done a Dr Seuss movie. Expectations weren't exactly through the roof, but I expected them to do so much better than this. The animation is pretty good, as expected for Illumination, but it can only dazzle me for about 5 minutes before I realise how dull and uninteresting this movie is.Again, if you liked this then good for you, but I just can't enjoy this movie.\n",

            "Review text: The thing about a remake is that there needs to be a reason to make it. When remakes have no reason to exist (other than to make a quick buck or millions of them), they fall flat, usually due to a lack effort. And therein lies the issue plaguing this 2018 version of Dr. Seuss' holiday classic about the mean-green-grumpy Grinch-it's a dull final product that likely resulting from a lack of effort. We know the Grinch stole Christmas, but who stole this movie's creativity?Just about everyone knows the classic Grinch story, but this one is a little bit different, so let's run through it. There's cheery, wintery town called Whoville filled with many delightful people called Whos. The Whos love Christmas, and they know how to celebrate the holiday right. They don't just deck the halls, they deck out the entire town with decorations, lights and a mountain-sized tree. It's all glorious.One young Who named Cindy-Lou (Cameron Seely) has an adventurous spirit and a kind heart, as central figures tend to have in these sorts of movies. She feels for her exhausted single mom who struggles to balance her time at work and at home taking care of Cindy-Lou and the twin boys. So, Cindy-Lou decides to ask Santa to help her mom by doing... something. Exactly what help Santa would provide is unclear, which makes any resolution problematic because we can't recognize the help if it arrives. If you think I'm overanalyzing this movie aimed at children, you're probably right.Any Who... living in the giant mountain adjacent to Whoville is The Grinch (Benedict Cumberbatch). The Grinch I remember as a child was a ruthless and nasty figure. Establishing him this way early on is crucial because it sets up a redemption story. This new Grinch starts off mildly rude at his worst and genuinely considerate at his best. A few half-hearted attempts to display his wickedness that fail and instead make him appear funny. The rest of the time, The Grinch is mostly pleasant. This robs viewers of the need to root for him to change because he's a decent guy the entire time. He politely interacts with an overly-jolly old friend, Mr. Bricklebaum, voiced by Kenan Thompson, who is doing some variation of his SNL character, neighbor Willie. Thompson's jubilance is good for a few laughs, the only ones you'll find in the movie. Despite his best efforts, his limited screen time doesn't afford him enough opportunity to earn this movie an overall label of \"funny.\"The rest of the attempts at humor are comprised mostly of cutaways that play like watered down versions of ones you'd see on Family Guy. There's also a dusting of lazy Who-based puns, like the inclusion a place called Who Foods, a play on Whole Foods. Like the rest of the movie, the jokes clearly were made with little effort.There isn't much else to say. This is a pointless remake that doesn't need to exist. A remake that has a reason to exist should provide a fresh voice while simultaneously honoring the past creation. This film does neither. If you want to watch a story about The Grinch, you'd be much better off revisiting the original cartoon classic or the more recent live-action iteration starring Jim Carrey.\n",

I like to leave reviews for movies and tv shows because I enjoy them, and I don't care about other people's views. I will give you my honest review as just a regular movie lover. Glad I didn't listen to critics on this film. It was great! A sold out theater. Kids and adults all laughed throughout the film. I went with my husband, sister, brother in law, and my niece and nephew. We all loved it equally. I enjoyed Jim Carey's version but I cannot compare them. I was wondering if I could like this without it having Jim Carey but I truly did. Heart-warming film with a slightly different take on it from the last film. To me, the dog, MAX stole the show! Great animation and effects. 3D is even better. To the people saying there was no storyline...ummm, there was! sheesh. Its about...well...THE GRINCH!! You don't take my advice, its just MY opinion, but I advise everyone to see this. Do not expect an Emmy winner, but it is still a great, warm and cozy holiday film.\n",

However, it fails in its heart which is always driven by actors' voicing and what a BIG FAIL this was - as many others have noted, so you know it's not just a few of us. First, WTH is Pharrell narrating?! Weakest voicing ever! NOTHING even approaching the dramatic storytelling of the classic's Karloff. And his hip-hop, rap interludes were simply wrong for this feature - maybe if you're setting the story in a rundown urban environment, maybe then it'd have fit, but it was totally out of place here. Then Benedict Cucumber-patch's voicing of our main Grinch character was way off base, nowhere up to the task, it was a pathetic reading of the script, the biggest letdown you could imagine. Finally, the naive, demure Cindy Lou Who from the classic is re-imagined as a hyper-active grrl power character which is also annoying and out of place. We can only hope this version is relegated to the dust bin of some Hollywood warehouse, never to be seen again.\n",

Save your money save your time and watch the original grinch cartoon that's only like 25 minutes long and you'll be a lot happier. Every funny moment in this movie with shown during the previews. And if you were hoping to see that adorable chubby reindeer for any period of time during the movie you will be disappointed also. He makes a very short appearance and everything that he does in the movie you have already seen in the previews. I didn't care for the narrators voice either. And let me tell you I am a Christmasholic. I listen to Christmas music in July. I buy Christmas presents all your long & stock them up. I usually have my Christmas tree up the first week in November.

Personally, I am not a fan of the original TV special, so I was dreading being dragged along to see this with the family, but I really liked it.It's a very modern take on the classic Dr. Seuss story. The plot line is basically the same, but the humor is a little different and it does play more for laughs.Personally, I prefer this one - my kids said they liked it equally with the original Grinch special.Unlike another reviewer who gave this a 1/10 and said Illumination animation was basic, I don't think it is at all. I think it is crisp and modern, and in comparison to the original, much softer and more likeable, but that's just me.I thought Benedict Cumberbatch was a weird choice for the main character's voice, but on seeing the movie, he was perfect of it.Go into this without any pre-judgment, unlike me, and you're sure to be highly entertained for around 90 minutes.I expected it to be terrible, but it will be a future Christmas favorite for our family!\n",

It's fairly impressive in terms of its visuals and voice-work but is certainly nothing new, or even compelling, when it comes to its narrative. Really, the visuals and voice-work are only really to the expected standard of today's bigger-budgeted animated fare and the strange 'Illumination-esque' designs, combined with the pulled-back (certainly from the, frankly, creepy Carrey incarnation) but still oddball Seuss stylings, prevent the piece from appearing as aesthetically-pleasing as anything that Disney - or, more specifically, Pixar - are putting out today. The point is that the fact that it looks pretty pretty isn't enough of a selling point to recommend the piece and that's probably the biggest selling point it has. I suppose someone who isn't familiar with the source-story and is young (or willing) enough not to notice the basic nature of the narrative may get more mileage from this bland but inoffensive, family-friendly Christmas flick. 5/10\n",

But the movie was excellent, really gave me the Christmas vibes and Mr. Grinch is actually really nicer then he seems. The graphics/drawings (however you wanna call them) are mind blowing ! It's a great movie that shows kids how Christmas is not about receiving gifts, but about spending time with the loved ones.However, I felt like they didn't represent the Grinch's mean side enough before gradually showing his nice side. And the script was a little (a lot) lame and cheesy, but I'm not going to base my review on that.Don't hesitate to watch it with kids, it was very touching:)\n",

I was not in the mood to see this because of the other grinch movies - the original and the Jim Carrey one, which I've seen too many times. However my husband and I had a great time with this new version. We loved the relatable mom (I have twins and worked graveshifts), loved that Cindy-Lou was adventureous and not so delicate, the Grinch was less grichy and more cranky which my husband and I loved (just for a bit of variety), and the relationship he has with maxx is so sweet. Plus it was visually amazing. Anyways, it isn't going to win an oscar, but my family loved the \"tweaked\" version.\n",

Many critics and people who have bashed the new movie say that the original is the only one needed. They say that this one is too bloated with extra details and additions to the story. From just my recent viewing of the film I have to disagree completely. The new characters and additions to the story made it even better and gave us more insight into why the grinch is so bitter. Overall The Grinch is a heartwarming film that spreads the true message of Christmas while keeping the simplicity of the original and adding thoughtful new characters and backstories to give greater meaning to the story by dr. Seuss. Don't listen to the critics and watch it yourself!!!\n",

            "Review text: I loved the \"Wreck-It Ralph\"; it was my favorite movie out of all the Disney movies from this decade (yes, even over \"Frozen\"), but I didn't think it needed a sequel. But this ruined it! Ralph and Vanellope became shells of their former selves, the fun arcade setting of the previous film was quickly discarded, and any potential a sequel may have had was out the window just to shill memes, other Disney properties, social justice values, and Gal Gadot. And I saw that ending coming a mile away, it was NEVER a question that Vanellope would stay in (ugh!) Slaughter Race and there'd be some \"heartfelt\" message about how Ralph should let her go. Don't even get me started on the princess scene, and how Disney made the annoying, shallow views the likes of Peggy Orstein have towards their characters official!The advertising and memes have been mentioned enough in other reviews, so I am going to focus on Slaughter Race and Shank. First of all, very uncreative names there. All Slaughter Race felt like was Disney's way of saying, \"look, we CAN put a realistic violent edgy game in here\". And Shank, no reason to love her at all; had this been fanfiction on the real Internet instead of a movie on a screen she'd have been criticized for being a Mary Sue. Both Vanellope's and Ralph's, especially the latter's characters suffered greatly just to make her look better. I resent how popular she has already become, and hope I don't run into her at any future visits to Disneyland or in any shows or parades there. Oh yeah, Slaughter Race is going to eventually go the way of Farmville, Five Nights at Freddy's, and Dream Daddy. What then, selfish little girl who I'm supposed to believe is Vanellope?Really, if they truly wanted to do more with the Wreck-It Ralph characters, there's still things they could've done while sticking to the gaming and arcade setting, without ruining Ralph and Vanellope, AND without virtue signaling. But we got this, and now I'm not even so sure I can enjoy the original film, the tie-in book \"One Sweet Race\", or even the princesses' original films/anything else with them anymore! And the box office gross is giving Disney the impression they've done good. If I could wish this movie out of existence, I would in a heartbeat.\n",

            "I don't wanna be negative Nancy on this one but I have to be honest. Wreck it Ralph 2 or Ralph Breaks the Internet, was a let down for me. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of good stuff in this movie, but in the end it fell short. It didn't deliver the promise of a true sequel to the things I personally enjoyed about the first film. It actually made me wonder if a sequel was even a good idea to begin with. The story tackles some real questions about friendships and growing up but not in a very comforting way. It makes me worry if this is not the best movie to send a message like this to younger audiences. Disney is known for being subtle when it comes to real world lessons but they've been more on the nose recently and it's starting to show some cracks. The movie doesn't carry over fun characters like Felix or Calhoun for anything more than cameos and that was super disappointing. They're replaced by new supporting characters like Gal Gadot's Shank and while the character design is spot on , she doesn't really add much to the story other than to move Vanellope's character along. All the best parts are in the trailers, in particular the Disney Princess cameos which is still hilarious but would've been more impactful if you didn't anticipate the jokes they had already shown. I actually hated the way they treated Ralph and Vanellope's characters in this movie. Granted they needed new obstacles for their relationship but it's almost like they're totally different characters from the last movie. Their personalities are inconsistent and I personally felt they said things that were totally out of character. It's hard to not like parts of this movie as it displays some stunning animation and carries plenty of good humor to keep you entertained. I just had to be straight up about how disappointed I was with this one. The first movie was appealing to me because of its love letter to gamers and the retro nostalgia in all of us who grew up with arcades and old school gaming. Yet at the center of it is a nice story about outcasts and accepting yourself for who you are. This movie took that away from me a little bit and I'm bummed I didn't love this movie more. It tried something different but it ultimately got too realistic for me and it made me emotionally unsettled. But not in the right ways. I still recommend you go see it as it has awesome animation and fantastic jokes but I don't know if I would buy this one. I'd like to just pretend it ends with the first movie. 6/10.\n",

            "Review text: I love Disney so much, I actually made this account just so I can leave a comment - in hopes that they will steer away from the direction that they are heading with films like these.I grew up with Disney films, I felt that they were warm, genuine, and intrinsically value laden. They taught kids about faith, belief, magic, and dreams even through tough times. This film, on the contrary teaches one to be reckless, unforgiving, and emotionally driven.Ralph was essentially reduced to a idiot in this movie. But the one positive trait he got to keep - his love and care for Vanellope, was so under appreciated that it was essentially mocked to be nothing more than an insecurity. This may be applicable for a relationship between two high schoolers saying goodbye as they head to universities, but the portrayal of Ralph's devotion is so one-sided that I geuinely felt bad for the guy.Vanellope was written as a child who essentially does whatever she wants because she finds meaning in the \"unknown\", and is ready to sacrifice anything to achieve it. Again this would have been OK with an adult character, but we are talking about a child venturing into a world of gangsters and explosions. The whole scenario only works because there's a noble and all powerful woman in this wasteland that seemingly would protect her for no good reason at all.I understand what Disney is trying to do symbolically here... but they got the characters, target audience, and overall feel of the film confused. They are trying to make an adult film in the guise of silly animation. It doesn't work well.Then I came on IMDB to read some reviews and it only revealed further failures like - where did the virus go? Where is the empowerment for little boys? You can read them for yourself the list goes on.Like I mentioned before - I grew up with Disney, and now I am planning to have children of my own. I don't feel that I would be comfortable with my child or toddler watching something like this. They may get the wrong message - its OK to do dangerous things just because it feels right, or its OK to be emotional and throw tantrums, and when someone wants to keep you away from your interest its not because they care for you - its because they are \"insecure\".Anyways I don't usually write these reviews. But I really wish they would bring some traditional values back to Disney movies. One's that aren't questionable. Ones that show realistic values and consequences of actions.\n",

Very disappointing, Disney seem to be clueless at the minute playing it safe and rehashing. It wouldn't surprise me if they did a stand alone movie with the little girl because they are so out of touch. I gave it a 1 star because it definitrly isn't a 7.5. Should be ~5\n",

He constantly makes mistakes throughout the \"movie\" (worst disney film in my opionion) and only learns until the very end when the stupid little candy girl is in danger. Throughout the whole movie the adventure is basically travelling across the internet and exploring what it exactly is; however, it doesn't accurately portray the internet and fails to connect the real world to world that Ralph lives in. For instance, in one part of the movie news spreads to the real world that a bunch of Ralphs have taken over the internet via a denial of service attack. The problem with this is that this explains sort of what a DOS attack is but fails at making sense whatsoever. My point is that Disney put some terms into the movie that kids and most people won't know. So as a result, they use the terms so loosely that it leaves people like me clueless as to how these things even happened in the first place. I have question such as: \"How did they get to the dark web in the first place?\" \"Why didn't they have to pay for the virus?\" or \"What even happened to the virus in the end?Maybe there are answers to the few questions I have listed or perhaps I should just conclude that its a kids movie. If you liked the movie, good for you but I can't recommend watching this unless you like movies that 1. don't make sense 2. have a dull sense of humor 3. and just are downright boring\n",

He believed he could be better, made friends, and realized that being himself was more important than being \"better\". He realized his faults and fixed them with his new friends.I guess 6 years ruins a character, huh? He's nothing short of an oblivious idiot in this movie. His reasoning, temperament, and lovable attitude from the first movie are nowhere to be seen. He's just a big dummy. His entire character was reduced to just being a pedestal for Vanellope to go through the same development Ralph went through in the first film. There is definitely a better way to have a character arc without ruining other characters for no reason. But that wouldn't be as interesting I guess.There were some enjoyable moments and some laughs, mainly when Ralph wasn't on-screen. Not to say he didn't have a couple moments.This movie is disappointing. I'm sure there's value in it if you're an 11 year old kid like I was.\n",

            "Review text: The original WRECK-IT-RALPH was hardly a Disney classic, but that film was nonetheless a clever commentary on videogames and provided a sense of comical, imaginative, tongue-in-cheek humor. RALPH BREAKS THE INTERNET, on the other hand, has only the occasional clever moment and at least one compelling concept. That concept, the visualization of the internet world, a sort of futuristic city straight out of one of the STAR WARS prequels, is admittingly impressive and imaginative. Sadly, that's the only good thing about this sequel, which otherwise ranks as one of the weakest Disney animated films I've seen in a long time. In trying to top everything that made the original so great, it ultimately trips over itself. It also reeks of commercialism as well; there's a painfully unnecessary sequence in which the princesses from previous Disney films show up in cameos. The primary reason seems to be to sell more merchandise and cheap laughs more than anything else. The film really hits rock bottom when Venelope sings a song clearly belonging in a better movie. Her deliberately shrill, tonedeaf singing voice -- intended for laughs -- again, falls flat, as do most of the jokes in this movie. Even the chemistry between the two leads doesn't have the same sincerity or heart as the original. This is mostly a noisy, frantic, emotionless, soulless mess with no heart. The filmmakers attempt to redeem this mess by shoehorning a \"toxic friendship\" message, but that moral has been done better, and is nowhere nearly as lame as this. Kids might get a kick out of this, and I can see why some internet nerds would gravitate to it, but on the whole, this is a major disappointment from the House that Walt built. Even the original was far more fresh and entertaining than its successor.\n",

Actually, just the opposite: They treat Ralph as the villain for trying to stop her.All this after a boring, uninspired and completely disjointed slog of a movie to sit through. The plot is bipolar, the characters come in two varieties -- cardboard, and despicable -- and the \"jokes\" felt old and dated even on this movie's theatrical release.What we have here is an exercise in Disney magic: An experiment to see if a movie with no redeemable qualities whatsoever can still rake in big bucks, big acclaim and big rewards just because it has a shot of the Disney castle in the opening sequence.We used to hold Disney to a higher standard. Now we let them get away with having no standards whatsoever.Stop rewarding this behavior. There are better movies out there.\n",

I have watched the first movie upwards of 10 times and there is not enough money in the world to make me watch even a minute of Uprising.

I just wish I had been in the room when someone thought that this was a good idea.\n",

            "Review text: What Pacific Rim 2 does well is that it has Jaegers in it, you can end the review there if you only like positives as unfortunately that's almost all I have. From the start PR2 is off on the wrong foot, where PR2 had a powerful intro that set the stage for an action blockbuster, PR2 limps into a first act that I would have trouble remembering if I had written it myself. Gone are the heroics of Gypsy Danger nobly fighting on with just one pilot, here our hero is presented as a plucky 20 something with daddy issues and his sidekick is a whiny teen mechanic.Everything I loved about the first film is absent from its sequel, Guillermo Del Toros direction is clearly missed with almost no personality given to any of the Kaiju(a paltry 3 of them with no distinguishing characteristics) and Ramin Djawadis original theme remains yet is only played once, over an hour into the film, with no additional score at all!John Boyega shows just enough personality to stay awake while the rest of the cast simply turn up as well, Idris Elba knew he wasn't starring in Shakespeare in the original but at least he had the decency to ham it up a bit. The exception to this is Burn Gorman and Charlie Days portrayal of bickering scientists and friends, however even this is destroyed with the reveal that Charlie Days character is actually the villain being controlled by Kaiju?!?! It's weak. The third act does too little too late to redeem the film, with three personality-less Kaiju morphing into one really big personality-less Kaiju which the heroes have to effectively suicide bomb to overcome. Overall this is a clear cash grab that even has the balls to tease a third film, despite being nearly devoid of any merit at all. 2/10\n",

It was made by people that do not care about what they do. They just turn-up for work and get paid, and that's it.Nothing more need be said about this bilge.Made with Chinese money. Just avoid all movies made by the Chinese. Avoid like the plague. Avoid all Netflix-made movies, too. The Chinese and Netflix do not know how to make movies. Just avoid.\n",

Jake Pentecost (John Boyega) teams up with Scott Eastwood, the son of an actor, and Cailee Spaeny, because young female \"Rey type\" role models are hip to fight rogue Jaegars. There is an academy to train Jaegar masters which reminded me of a bad \"Starship Troopers.\" There is a lot of machines fighting machines in case you didn't get enough of that in Transformers or Iron Man. And like those two films the battles are long and dragged out. Tween film.\n",

I can't believe it because it just has a TV movie vibe to it.Why does this movie take place in China when the original was paying homage to Japanese giant monster and mecha films?
